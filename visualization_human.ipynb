performance, aimed at determining whether the distinction between admissible senses and inadmissible ones entailed by our type abstractions were in accord with human judgement.\"],[\"This is not surprising since the parallel texts contain implicit knowledge about the sense of an ambiguous word, which has been provided by human translators.\"],[\"Disparities in how often this phenomenon occurs in human translated texts (18%) for English, French, and German as opposed to machine translated ones (8%) are observed and the work aims to more widely capture the natural implicitation of DMs in statistical MT (SMT).\"],[\"The results of our human evaluation study are shown in Table 5 .\"],[\"Throughout the competition, the task of predicting funniness given human judgement scores seemed overall challenging for most participants.\"],[\"Curating such a dataset is technically challenging since 1) annotating such a large-scale dataset require costly human labor, and 2) given the fine-granularity of the emotion and intent labels, the human labeling task is more difficult and error-prone compared to the more coarse grained Angry-Happy-Sad emotion categories.\"],[\"Step 1 is done using human assessors who judge affect in a series of test samples.\"],[\"In contrast to these approaches, which are strictly performance-oriented, we envision a distribution of forces between human modeling of linguistically motivated and task-relevant factors and computation of the role of these factors regarding the choice among alternatives.\"],[\"Manual Paraphrase The simulated dialog

systems, to the reported effectiveness of one-on-one tutorial instruction by human tutors.\"],[\"Varying types of professionals are involved with each of the five categories listed above: \\u2022 In statistical MT development, most of the work is done by software engineers, mathematicians, and computational linguists who use corpora of human translations as training data for their systems (therefore involving human translation as the basis for raw MT); \\u2022 For triage, the evaluation of MT output is typically done by monolingual subjectmatter experts who decide which documents to send to human translators; \\u2022 Classic post-editing (where errors in raw machine translation are corrected from beginning to end) may be done by professional translators, but is often done by others, depending on the requirements (e.g., in some post-editing scenarios, minimal corrections are made by individuals trained specifically in post-editing, but who do not otherwise provide translation services); and finally, \\u2022 For the two rightmost use cases, MT as an optional resource and \\\"classic\\\" human translation (where MT is not involved), services are provided by professional (or paraprofessional) translators.\"],[\"To cope with this problem, we are developing an interactive option that at certain pivotal points of text processing is expected to ask for human

          "This whole procedure proves to be very expensive because it requires the constant training of personnel, as the level of accuracy of annotation depends drastically of the level of domain specific knowledge of the human annotator.",
          "With these considerations in mind, we designed a domain, Fruit Carts, and a set of corresponding tasks in order to elicit human language production for two purposes: 1) the testing of psycholinguistic hypotheses, specifically that object complexity modulates referential strategy, and more generally the exploration of the relationship between visual context and human-human dialogue, and 2) research and development of dialogue systems that understand language as it unfolds, taking pragmatic factors into account early in the recognition process.",

          "Our manual evaluation approach has one central limitation: Though we provide local context to the human annotators, if the ability to distinguish the sarcastic intent of a comment relies on knowledge of, for instance, the commenter's comment history or relevant news, then human annotators may not perform well.",
          "Its goal is to provide a unified framework for sharing, training and testing dialog models; integration of Amazon Mechanical Turk for data collection, human evaluation, and online/reinforcement learning; and a repository of machine learning models for comparing with others' models, and improving upon existing architectures.",
          "It is important to underline that the strong MCS baseline cannot be used in practice, since human input is required to indicate which sense of a word is the most frequent in a given text (a word's dominant sense will vary across domains and text genres).",
          "In this work, Zapata demonstrates the range of interaction between humans and machines in translation processes and claims that a new turn in translation technology is needed, with the human translator as the central axis of investigation.",

          "We designed an additional test of our method's performance, aimed at determining whether the distinction between admissible senses and inadmissible ones entailed by our type abstractions were in accord with human judgement.",
          "This is not surprising since the parallel texts contain implicit knowledge about the sense of an ambiguous word, which has been provided by human translators.",
          "Disparities in how often this phenomenon occurs in human translated texts (18%) for English, French, and German as opposed to machine translated ones (8%) are observed and the work aims to more widely capture the natural implicitation of DMs in statistical MT (SMT).",
          "The results of our human evaluation study are shown in Table 5 .",
          "Throughout the competition, the task of predicting funniness given human judgement scores seemed overall challenging for most participants.",
          "Curating such a dataset is technically challenging since 1) annotating such a large-scale dataset require costly human labor, and 2) given the fine-granularity of the emotion and intent labels, the human labeling task is more difficult and error-prone compared to the more coarse grained Angry-Happy-Sad emotion categories.",
          "Step 1 is done using human assessors who judge affect in a series of test samples.",
          "In contrast to these approaches, which are strictly performance-oriented, we envision a distribution of forces between human modeling of linguistically motivated and task-relevant factors and computation of the role of these factors regarding the choice among alternatives.",

          "We first outline prior work on tasks and models to measure textual coherence, then describe the framework for the Zero-Shot Shuffle Test, showing how to adapt common models to the setting, and finally propose a variation to the Shuffle Test that significantly increases the challenge for models, while not affecting human performance at the task.",
          "She attributed the interest in emulating the effectiveness of human tutors with artificially intelligent computerized instructional systems, to the reported effectiveness of one-on-one tutorial instruction by human tutors.",
          "Varying types of professionals are involved with each of the five categories listed above: • In statistical MT development, most of the work is done by software engineers, mathematicians, and computational linguists who use corpora of human translations as training data for their systems (therefore involving human translation as the basis for raw MT); • For triage, the evaluation of MT output is typically done by monolingual subjectmatter experts who decide which documents to send to human translators; • Classic post-editing (where errors in raw machine translation are corrected from beginning to end) may be done by professional translators, but is often done by others, depending on the requirements (e.g., in some post-editing scenarios, minimal corrections are made by individuals trained specifically in post-editing, but who do not otherwise provide translation services); and finally, • For the two rightmost use cases, MT as an optional resource and \"classic\" human translation (where MT is not involved), services are provided by professional (or paraprofessional) translators.",
          "To cope with this problem, we are developing an interactive option that at certain pivotal points of text processing is expected to ask for human intervention and use human assistance to resolve those ambiguities that are beyond the scope of linguistic knowledge of the system (Boguslavsky et al 2003) .",

          "We first outline prior work on tasks and models to measure textual coherence, then describe the framework for the Zero-Shot Shuffle Test, showing how to adapt common models to the setting, and finally propose a variation to the Shuffle Test that significantly increases the challenge for models, while not affecting human performance at the task.",

          "Varying types of professionals are involved with each of the five categories listed above: • In statistical MT development, most of the work is done by software engineers, mathematicians, and computational linguists who use corpora of human translations as training data for their systems (therefore involving human translation as the basis for raw MT); • For triage, the evaluation of MT output is typically done by monolingual subjectmatter experts who decide which documents to send to human translators; • Classic post-editing (where errors in raw machine translation are corrected from beginning to end) may be done by professional translators, but is often done by others, depending on the requirements (e.g., in some post-editing scenarios, minimal corrections are made by individuals trained specifically in post-editing, but who do not otherwise provide translation services); and finally, • For the two rightmost use cases, MT as an optional resource and \"classic\" human translation (where MT is not involved), services are provided by professional (or paraprofessional) translators.",
          "To cope with this problem, we are developing an interactive option that at certain pivotal points of text processing is expected to ask for human intervention and use human assistance to resolve those ambiguities that are beyond the scope of linguistic knowledge of the system (Boguslavsky et al 2003) .",

          "This whole procedure proves to be very expensive because it requires the constant training of personnel, as the level of accuracy of annotation depends drastically of the level of domain specific knowledge of the human annotator.",
          "With these considerations in mind, we designed a domain, Fruit Carts, and a set of corresponding tasks in order to elicit human language production for two purposes: 1) the testing of psycholinguistic hypotheses, specifically that object complexity modulates referential strategy, and more generally the exploration of the relationship between visual context and human-human dialogue, and 2) research and development of dialogue systems that understand language as it unfolds, taking pragmatic factors into account early in the recognition process.",

          "Table 5 shows an example conversation where it might be difficult for even a human to classify the utterances without the associated multi-modal cues.",
          "The upper bound in the first two lines shows the correlations between the human ratings from the two experiments, i.e., between the 244 compound whole ratings and the respective compound-modifier and compound-head ratings.",
          "Our manual evaluation approach has one central limitation: Though we provide local context to the human annotators, if the ability to distinguish the sarcastic intent of a comment relies on knowledge of, for instance, the commenter's comment history or relevant news, then human annotators may not perform well.",
          "Its goal is to provide a unified framework for sharing, training and testing dialog models; integration of Amazon Mechanical Turk for data collection, human evaluation, and online/reinforcement learning; and a repository of machine learning models for comparing with others' models, and improving upon existing architectures.",
          "It is important to underline that the strong MCS baseline cannot be used in practice, since human input is required to indicate which sense of a word is the most frequent in a given text (a word's dominant sense will vary across domains and text genres).",
          "In this work, Zapata demonstrates the range of interaction between humans and machines in translation processes and claims that a new turn in translation technology is needed, with the human translator as the central axis of investigation.",

          "Empirical results demonstrate that, for the first time, a human-authored commonsense knowledge graph is surpassed by our automatically distilled variant in all three criteria: quantity, quality, and diversity.",
          "2019) raters are asked to compare two existing conversation logs, and the authors consider both the case of human-model chat logs, and model-model (self-chat) logs, where the former are actually a different set of human conversationalists compared to the final raters.",
          "We adopt the metrics in Martins and Smith (2009) to measure the unigram-level macro precision, recall, and F1-measure with respect to human annotated compression.",
          "We designed an additional test of our method's performance, aimed at determining whether the distinction between admissible senses and inadmissible ones entailed by our type abstractions were in accord with human judgement.",
          "This is not surprising since the parallel texts contain implicit knowledge about the sense of an ambiguous word, which has been provided by human translators.",
          "Disparities in how often this phenomenon occurs in human translated texts (18%) for English, French, and German as opposed to machine translated ones (8%) are observed and the work aims to more widely capture the natural implicitation of DMs in statistical MT (SMT).",
          "The results of our human evaluation study are shown in Table 5 .",
          "Throughout the competition, the task of predicting funniness given human judgement scores seemed overall challenging for most participants.",
          "Curating such a dataset is technically challenging since 1) annotating such a large-scale dataset require costly human labor, and 2) given the fine-granularity of the emotion and intent labels, the human labeling task is more difficult and error-prone compared to the more coarse grained Angry-Happy-Sad emotion categories.",
          "Step 1 is done using human assessors who judge affect in a series of test samples.",
          "In contrast to these approaches, which are strictly performance-oriented, we envision a distribution of forces between human modeling of linguistically motivated and task-relevant factors and computation of the role of these factors regarding the choice among alternatives.",

          "In addition, we believe that our hierarchical multilabel schemes with a manageable size and structure can be easily modified to customized models, as well as more advanced human-machine conversational models.",
          "In the ga-case (subject), of three candidates, \"electronic detectors,\" \"physicists,\" and \"large amounts of data,\" only \"physicists\" satisfies the semantic constraint, human, in the case frame of the verb kaiseki-suru in Table 2 .",
          "The evaluation of sentence reduction (see (Jing, 2000) for details) used a corpus of 500 sentences and their reduced forms in human-written abstracts.",
          "We first outline prior work on tasks and models to measure textual coherence, then describe the framework for the Zero-Shot Shuffle Test, showing how to adapt common models to the setting, and finally propose a variation to the Shuffle Test that significantly increases the challenge for models, while not affecting human performance at the task.",
          "She attributed the interest in emulating the effectiveness of human tutors with artificially intelligent computerized instructional systems, to the reported effectiveness of one-on-one tutorial instruction by human tutors.",
          "Varying types of professionals are involved with each of the five categories listed above: • In statistical MT development, most of the work is done by software engineers, mathematicians, and computational linguists who use corpora of human translations as training data for their systems (therefore involving human translation as the basis for raw MT); • For triage, the evaluation of MT output is typically done by monolingual subjectmatter experts who decide which documents to send to human translators; • Classic post-editing (where errors in raw machine translation are corrected from beginning to end) may be done by professional translators, but is often done by others, depending on the requirements (e.g., in some post-editing scenarios, minimal corrections are made by individuals trained specifically in post-editing, but who do not otherwise provide translation services); and finally, • For the two rightmost use cases, MT as an optional resource and \"classic\" human translation (where MT is not involved), services are provided by professional (or paraprofessional) translators.",
          "To cope with this problem, we are developing an interactive option that at certain pivotal points of text processing is expected to ask for human intervention and use human assistance to resolve those ambiguities that are beyond the scope of linguistic knowledge of the system (Boguslavsky et al 2003) .",

          "Varying types of professionals are involved with each of the five categories listed above: • In statistical MT development, most of the work is done by software engineers, mathematicians, and computational linguists who use corpora of human translations as training data for their systems (therefore involving human translation as the basis for raw MT); • For triage, the evaluation of MT output is typically done by monolingual subjectmatter experts who decide which documents to send to human translators; • Classic post-editing (where errors in raw machine translation are corrected from beginning to end) may be done by professional translators, but is often done by others, depending on the requirements (e.g., in some post-editing scenarios, minimal corrections are made by individuals trained specifically in post-editing, but who do not otherwise provide translation services); and finally, • For the two rightmost use cases, MT as an optional resource and \"classic\" human translation (where MT is not involved), services are provided by professional (or paraprofessional) translators.",
          "To cope with this problem, we are developing an interactive option that at certain pivotal points of text processing is expected to ask for human intervention and use human assistance to resolve those ambiguities that are beyond the scope of linguistic knowledge of the system (Boguslavsky et al 2003) .",

          "This whole procedure proves to be very expensive because it requires the constant training of personnel, as the level of accuracy of annotation depends drastically of the level of domain specific knowledge of the human annotator.",
          "With these considerations in mind, we designed a domain, Fruit Carts, and a set of corresponding tasks in order to elicit human language production for two purposes: 1) the testing of psycholinguistic hypotheses, specifically that object complexity modulates referential strategy, and more generally the exploration of the relationship between visual context and human-human dialogue, and 2) research and development of dialogue systems that understand language as it unfolds, taking pragmatic factors into account early in the recognition process.",

          "Table 5 shows an example conversation where it might be difficult for even a human to classify the utterances without the associated multi-modal cues.",
          "The upper bound in the first two lines shows the correlations between the human ratings from the two experiments, i.e., between the 244 compound whole ratings and the respective compound-modifier and compound-head ratings.",
          "Our manual evaluation approach has one central limitation: Though we provide local context to the human annotators, if the ability to distinguish the sarcastic intent of a comment relies on knowledge of, for instance, the commenter's comment history or relevant news, then human annotators may not perform well.",
          "Its goal is to provide a unified framework for sharing, training and testing dialog models; integration of Amazon Mechanical Turk for data collection, human evaluation, and online/reinforcement learning; and a repository of machine learning models for comparing with others' models, and improving upon existing architectures.",
          "It is important to underline that the strong MCS baseline cannot be used in practice, since human input is required to indicate which sense of a word is the most frequent in a given text (a word's dominant sense will vary across domains and text genres).",
          "In this work, Zapata demonstrates the range of interaction between humans and machines in translation processes and claims that a new turn in translation technology is needed, with the human translator as the central axis of investigation.",

          "Empirical results demonstrate that, for the first time, a human-authored commonsense knowledge graph is surpassed by our automatically distilled variant in all three criteria: quantity, quality, and diversity.",
          "2019) raters are asked to compare two existing conversation logs, and the authors consider both the case of human-model chat logs, and model-model (self-chat) logs, where the former are actually a different set of human conversationalists compared to the final raters.",
          "We adopt the metrics in Martins and Smith (2009) to measure the unigram-level macro precision, recall, and F1-measure with respect to human annotated compression.",
          "We designed an additional test of our method's performance, aimed at determining whether the distinction between admissible senses and inadmissible ones entailed by our type abstractions were in accord with human judgement.",
          "This is not surprising since the parallel texts contain implicit knowledge about the sense of an ambiguous word, which has been provided by human translators.",
          "Disparities in how often this phenomenon occurs in human translated texts (18%) for English, French, and German as opposed to machine translated ones (8%) are observed and the work aims to more widely capture the natural implicitation of DMs in statistical MT (SMT).",
          "The results of our human evaluation study are shown in Table 5 .",
          "Throughout the competition, the task of predicting funniness given human judgement scores seemed overall challenging for most participants.",
          "Curating such a dataset is technically challenging since 1) annotating such a large-scale dataset require costly human labor, and 2) given the fine-granularity of the emotion and intent labels, the human labeling task is more difficult and error-prone compared to the more coarse grained Angry-Happy-Sad emotion categories.",
          "Step 1 is done using human assessors who judge affect in a series of test samples.",
          "In contrast to these approaches, which are strictly performance-oriented, we envision a distribution of forces between human modeling of linguistically motivated and task-relevant factors and computation of the role of these factors regarding the choice among alternatives.",

          "In addition, we believe that our hierarchical multilabel schemes with a manageable size and structure can be easily modified to customized models, as well as more advanced human-machine conversational models.",
          "In the ga-case (subject), of three candidates, \"electronic detectors,\" \"physicists,\" and \"large amounts of data,\" only \"physicists\" satisfies the semantic constraint, human, in the case frame of the verb kaiseki-suru in Table 2 .",
          "The evaluation of sentence reduction (see (Jing, 2000) for details) used a corpus of 500 sentences and their reduced forms in human-written abstracts.",
          "We first outline prior work on tasks and models to measure textual coherence, then describe the framework for the Zero-Shot Shuffle Test, showing how to adapt common models to the setting, and finally propose a variation to the Shuffle Test that significantly increases the challenge for models, while not affecting human performance at the task.",
          "She attributed the interest in emulating the effectiveness of human tutors with artificially intelligent computerized instructional systems, to the reported effectiveness of one-on-one tutorial instruction by human tutors.",
          "Varying types of professionals are involved with each of the five categories listed above: • In statistical MT development, most of the work is done by software engineers, mathematicians, and computational linguists who use corpora of human translations as training data for their systems (therefore involving human translation as the basis for raw MT); • For triage, the evaluation of MT output is typically done by monolingual subjectmatter experts who decide which documents to send to human translators; • Classic post-editing (where errors in raw machine translation are corrected from beginning to end) may be done by professional translators, but is often done by others, depending on the requirements (e.g., in some post-editing scenarios, minimal corrections are made by individuals trained specifically in post-editing, but who do not otherwise provide translation services); and finally, • For the two rightmost use cases, MT as an optional resource and \"classic\" human translation (where MT is not involved), services are provided by professional (or paraprofessional) translators.",
          "To cope with this problem, we are developing an interactive option that at certain pivotal points of text processing is expected to ask for human intervention and use human assistance to resolve those ambiguities that are beyond the scope of linguistic knowledge of the system (Boguslavsky et al 2003) .",

in a given text (a word's dominant sense will vary across domains and text genres).\",\"In this work, Zapata demonstrates the range of interaction between humans and machines in translation processes

additional test of our method's performance, aimed at determining whether the distinction between admissible senses and inadmissible ones entailed by our type abstractions were in accord with human

often this phenomenon occurs in human translated texts (18%) for English, French, and German as opposed to machine translated ones (8%) are observed and the work aims to more widely capture the natural implicitation of DMs in statistical MT (SMT).\",\"The results of our human evaluation study are shown in Table 5 .\",\"Throughout the competition, the task of predicting funniness given human judgement scores seemed overall challenging for most participants.\",\"Curating such a dataset is technically challenging since 1) annotating such a large-scale dataset require costly human labor, and 2) given the fine-granularity of the emotion and intent labels, the human labeling task is more difficult and error-prone compared to the more coarse grained Angry-Happy-Sad emotion categories.\",\"Step 1 is done using human assessors who judge affect in a series of test samples.\",\"In contrast to these approaches, which are strictly performance-oriented, we envision a

listed above: \\u2022 In statistical MT development, most of the work is done by software engineers, mathematicians, and computational linguists who use corpora of human translations as training data for their systems (therefore involving human translation as the basis for raw MT); \\u2022 For triage, the evaluation of MT output is typically done by monolingual subjectmatter experts who decide which documents to send to human translators; \\u2022 Classic post-editing (where errors in raw machine translation are corrected from beginning to end) may be done by professional translators, but is often done by others, depending on the requirements (e.g., in some post-editing scenarios, minimal corrections are made by individuals trained specifically in post-editing, but who do not otherwise provide translation services); and finally, \\u2022 For the two rightmost use cases, MT as an optional resource and \\\"classic\\\" human translation (where MT is not involved), services are provided
