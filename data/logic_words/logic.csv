the field of mformahon retneval, however, the corresponding task of automahc abstracting, has been considered from Its very beganmng (Luhn 58 ), a problem that can be dealt with by surface-level pattern matching techmques and statLshcal methods originally developed for lexlcal selection tasks such as automahc mdeydng or classlficahon (Salton et al 94) Thin approach has recently been given a lot of attenhon agaan, mmnly due to the renamsance of statlshcal methodology m the field of parsing and tagging (Kuplec 95) Given a stahstlcal approach, however, automahc abstracting bods down to a sentence extrachon problem, vsz deterrrmnmg the most salient sentences based on surface-level lexlcal or positional lndicatom We adhere to the knowledge-based paradigm of abstractmg and propose to fully integrate text knowledge abstraction m a terminological reasonmg model In such an approach, text understanding and summarlzatton are considered within a formally homogeneous framework Moreover,

Given the gold label 𝑦 * of the query 𝑞 in the document D, the objective function is to maximize the likelihood as follows: L(𝑤, 𝜃)= log 𝑝 𝑤, 𝜃 (𝑦 * |𝑞) (1) Due to the existence of latent variables in the objective function L, we use the EM algorithm for optimization (Sec.",18,19

8064,363238,"This paper summarizes such a formalization, 1 based on the typed attribute-value logic of (Car92).",15,16
8065,363238,"This logic is distinguished by its strong interpretation of appropriateness, a set of conditions that tell us which features an object of a given type can have, and which types a feature's value can have.",1,2
8066,363238,"Previous approaches have required that every parameter of a subtype should be a parameter of all of its supertypes, and vice versa; thus, it would not be 1 The full version of this paper presents a denotational semantics of the logic described here.",43,44
8067,363238,"2 The present one eliminates this restriction (Section 2) by requiring the existence of a simple most general type (which (Car92)'s logic requires anyway), which is then used during type-checking and inferencing to interpret new parameters.",27,28
8068,363238,"All previous approaches deal only with fixed-arity terms; and none but one uses a feature logic, with the one, CUF (Dot92), being an implementation that permits parametric lists only as a special case.",18,19
8069,363238,"Meet semilatticehood, a requirement of (Car92)'s logic as well, allows us to talk about unification, because we have a unique mostgeneral unifier for every unifiable pair of types.",10,11
8070,363238,"These putative ""macros"" would be, in many cases, equivalent only to infinite descriptions without such macros, and thus would extend the power of the description language beyond the limits of HPSG's own logic and model theory.",38,39
8071,363238,"5 Signature Subsumption Now that parametric type signatures have been formalized, one can ask whether parametric types really add something to the expressive power of typed attribute-value logic.",30,31
8072,363238,"Conclusion This paper presents a formal definition of parametric type hierarchies and signatures, extending (Car92)'s logic to the parametric case through equivalent induced non-parametric signatures.",19,20
8073,6618715,"Suffice it to say here that they are implemented in a uniform way (in all three cases by converting a logic formula -either CNF or something more complicated -into a DNF formula), and all can use both sound and unsound (but good) heuristics to deal successfully with the potentially explosive combinatorics inherent in the conversion to DNF.",21,22

9912,16273847,"6 Translation to Sch6nfinkel-Bernays class The Schhnfinkel-Bernays class (see [Lewis, 1980] ) consists of function-free first-order formulae which have the form: 3xt ... xnVyl • .. ym6 In this section we show that the attributive logic developed in this paper can be encoded within the SchSnfinkel-Bernays subclass of first-order formulae by extending the approach developed in [Johnson, 1991] .",48,49
9913,16273847,This means that an unrestricted variant of our logic which does not restrict the universal role quantification cannot be expressed within the SchSnfinkel-Bernays class.,8,9

9915,16273847,Let x be a variable free in T. Then T is consistent iff the formula (x = T) 6 is consistent where 6 is a translation function from our extended feature logic into the SchSnfinkel-Bernays class.,33,34
9916,16273847,"However the integration of concept languages with feature logics has been problematic due to the fact the while path equations do not lead to increased computational complexity in feature logic the addition of rolevalue-maps (which are the relational analog of path equations) in concept languages causes undecidability [Schmidt-Schant3, 1989 ].",29,30
9917,16273847,"This blocks a straightforward integration of a variable-free concept language such as ALC [Schmidt-SchanB and Smolka, 1991] with a variable-free feature logic [Smolka, 1991] .",30,31
9918,16273847,Summary and Conclusions In this paper we have provided an extended feature logic (excluding disjunctions and negations) with a range of constraints involving set descriptions.,12,13
9919,16273847,We have given a model theoretic semantics to our extended logic which shows that a simple and elegant formalisation of set descriptions is possible if we add relational attributes to our logic as opposed to just functional attributes available in feature logic.,10,11

9921,16273847,We have given a model theoretic semantics to our extended logic which shows that a simple and elegant formalisation of set descriptions is possible if we add relational attributes to our logic as opposed to just functional attributes available in feature logic.,41,42
9922,16273847,"For realistic implementation of the logic described in this paper, further investigation is needed to develop concrete algorithms that are reasonably efficient in the average case.",5,6
9923,16273847,We believe that the logic described in this paper provides both a better picture of the formal aspects of current constraint based grammar formalisms which employ set descriptions and at the same time gives a basis for building knowledge representation tools in order to support grammar development within these formalisms.,4,5
9924,1477127,Notice that this natural-deduction-style proof in the type logic corresponds very closely to the phrasestructure tree one would like to adopt in an analysis with traces.,12,13
9925,1477127,"On the theoretical side we think that this result for S01 is also of some importance, since SDI_ exhibits a core of logical behaviour that any (Lambek-based) logic must have which accounts for non-peripheral extraction by some form of permutation.",33,34
9926,1883639,"In this paper we show how nonmonotonic operations can also be user-defined by applying default logic (Reiter, 1980) and generalizing previous results on nonmonotonic sorts (Young and Rounds, 1993) .",17,18
9927,1883639,"This generalization results in a default logic similar to (Reiter, 1980) , but where subsumption and unification are used instead of logical truth and consistency.",6,7
9928,1883639,"Finally, there is a close relationship to Reiter's (1980) default logic.",14,15
9929,1883639,Finally I conclude with a discussion of the relation to Reiter's default logic and computational properties of the approach.,13,14
9930,1883639,In Reiter's default logic this is expressed with the following normal default rule. :# #,4,5
9931,1883639,In default logic this is usually expressed as 7 The next question is how such defined nonmonotonic rules are going to be interpreted in a unification framework.,2,3
9932,1883639,The first condition (3' _C ~) is a restriction similar to the restriction to normal default rules in Reiter's (1980) default logic.,28,29
9933,1883639,In this section I will discuss the relation of this work to Reiter's (1980) default logic.,18,19
9934,1883639,"Compared with Reiter's default logic, our notion of nonmonotonic sorts corresponds to default theories.",5,6
9935,1883639,Unification of nonmonotonic sorts would then correspond to merging two default theories into one single theory and our notion of explaining a nonmonotonic sort corresponds to computing the extension of a default theory in default logic.,35,36
9936,1883639,In default logic there is often a restriction to normal-default theories since non-normal default theories are not even semi-decidable.,2,3
9937,1883639,"As mentioned previously there is with nonmonotonic sorts, as well as normal default logic, a possibility of conflicting defaults and thus multiple nonmonotonic extensions for a structure.",14,15
9938,1883639,"One difference is that nonmonotonic sorts allow that the application of a nonmonotonic rule leads to fail, i.e. an inconsistent structure, while default logic does not allow this outcome.",25,26
9939,1883639,"However, since fail is allowed as a valid explanation for a nonmonotonic sort, there is, as for normal default logic, always at least one explanation for a sort.",22,23
9940,1883639,"However, this generalization is outside default logic.",7,8
9941,256905,"This seems to contradict standard logic, but we show (in Section 4) that some logical formalisms, namely a fragment of the Lambek calculus (LC, first introduced by Lambek [1958] ), can handle adjunction.",5,6

10290,287454,I INTRODUCTION In this paper we present a modal temporal logic that has been developed for reasoning about change in data bases.,10,11
10291,287454,II REPRESENTATION We have chosen to use a modal temporal logic.,10,11
10292,287454,There are two basic requirements which lead us toward logic and away from methods such as Petri nets.,9,10
10293,287454,"That is, our knowledge of temporal situations may be incomplete and indefinite, and as others have argued [Moore 821 (as a recent example), methods based on formal logic (though usually flrst-order) are the only ones that have so far been capable of dealing with problems of this nature.",33,34
10294,287454,"In contrast to flrst-order representations, modal temporal logic makes a fundamental distinction between variability over time (as expressed by modal temporal operators) and variability in a state (as expressed using propositional or flrst-order languages).",10,11
10295,287454,Modal temporal logic also reflects the temporally indefinite structure of language in a way that is more natural than the commaon method of using state variables and constants in a flrst-order logic.,2,3
10296,287454,Modal temporal logic also reflects the temporally indefinite structure of language in a way that is more natural than the commaon method of using state variables and constants in a flrst-order logic.,33,34

10298,287454,"On the side of flrst-order logic, however, is expressive power that is not necessarily present in modal temporal logic. (",22,23
10299,287454,"Furthermore, in cases where it is necessary for the temporal structure to be dense or continuous, there is no immediate argument against modal temporal logic in general. (",26,27
10300,287454,"That Is, one could develop a modal temporal logic that models a continuous structure of time [RU 71].)",9,10
10301,287454,"The future fragment of the logic is based on the unified branching temporal logic of [BMP 81], which introduces branches and quantifies over them to make it possible to describe properties on some or all futures.",5,6
10302,287454,"The future fragment of the logic is based on the unified branching temporal logic of [BMP 81], which introduces branches and quantifies over them to make it possible to describe properties on some or all futures.",13,14
10303,287454,"The relation "">"" is the transitive closure of R. The satisfaction of a formula p at a state s in a structure T, <T,s> I = p, is defined as follows : <T,s>I = p iff pG~s), for p~ <T,s>l = -p iff not <T,s>i=p <T,s>l = p v q Iff <T,s>J=p or <T,s>l=q At'((t'~b & s>t'>t) -9 <T,t'>l=p))) (q is true at some time of the past and since q is true p is true) A formula p is valid iff for every structure T and every state s in T, <T,s> I= p. III MODELLING CHANGE IN KNOWLEDGE BASES As noted earlier, this logic was developed to reason about change in data bases.",172,173
10304,287454,I see no easy way around this problem in this logic.,10,11
10305,287454,"Thus for some c' which is not equal to any of cl...cn, it is provable in the completed theory that ~(Q c'), which was not provable in the original theory T. This axiom captures our intuitive notions about Q. 2 The completion axiom for temporal logic is developed by introducing time propositions.",52,53
10306,287454,"In the logic, the general counterhistorical has the form: P(EFp).",2,3
10307,287454,This difference is largely due to the intended application of the logic.,11,12
10308,18177048,"This device can be thought of as the attributevalue equivalent of a bound variable of logic, and though it is not appropriate for all kinds of anaphoric dependence, it is ubiquitous.",15,16
10309,17712124,"Theoretical linguistics took an important new turn with the work of Montague on the logic of English and later expansions and variants of his theory (e.g., see Thomason 1974a , Partee 1976a , and Cresswell 1973) .",14,15
10310,17712124,"Moreover, the grammar realizes the rule-to-rule hypothesis, pairing each syntactic rule with a Montaguelike semantic rule that supplies the intensional logic translation of the constituent admitted by the syntactic rule.",26,27
10311,17712124,"First, however, we would like to motivate our attempt to reformulate Gazdar's semantic rules so as to yield 'conventional' logical translations (Section 2), and to explain the syntactic and semantic idiosyncrasies of our target logic (Section 3).",42,43
10312,17712124,"4 The logic employed by Montague in his first formal fragment of English comes rather close to what we have in mind (Montague 1970a) , while the intensional logics of the later fragments introduce the unconventional features we hope to avoid (1970b,c) .",2,3
10313,17712124,"The most obvious difference is that intensional logic translations of natural language sentences conform closely with the surface structure of those sentences, except for some re-ordering of phrases, the introduction of brackets, variables and certain logical operators, and (perhaps) the reduction of idioms.",7,8
10314,17712124,"For example, since the constituent structure of ""John loves Mary"" is [John [loves Mary]], the intensional logic translation likewise isolates a component translating the VP ""loves Mary"", composing this VP-translation with the translation of ""John"" to give the sentence formula.",24,25
10315,17712124,"The semantic rule states that the intensional logic translation of the S-constituent is compounded of the VP-translation (as functor) and the NP-translation (as operand), where the latter is first to be prefixed with the intension operator A. In general, a primed syntactic symbol denotes the logical translation of the corresponding constituent, and a double-primed symbol the logical translation prefixed with the intension operator (thus, NP"" stands for ANP').",7,8
10316,17712124,"7 With respect to our objective of building a comprehensible, expandable natural language understanding system, the simplicity of Gazdar's semantic rules and their one-to-one correspondence to phrase structure rules is extremely attractive; however, the semantics of the intensional logic translations, as sketched above, seems to us quite unnatural.",47,48
10317,17712124,"Such objections would carry no weight if the sole purpose of formal semantics were to provide an explication of intuitions about truth and logical consequence, for in that area intensional logic is remarkably successful.",31,32
10318,17712124,"But formal semantics should also do justice to our intuitions about the relationship between word and object, where those intuitions are clear -and intensional logic seems at odds with some of the clearest of those intuitions.",25,26
10319,17712124,8 There is also a computational objection to intensional logic translations.,9,10
10320,17712124,"Even such idiosyncratic formalisms as Schank's conceptual depen~lency theory (Schank 1973) are much more akin to, say, first order modal logic than to any form of intensional logic -see Schubert 1976) .",27,28
10321,17712124,"Even such idiosyncratic formalisms as Schank's conceptual depen~lency theory (Schank 1973) are much more akin to, say, first order modal logic than to any form of intensional logic -see Schubert 1976) .",34,35
10322,17712124,How are intensional logic formulas to be connected up with stored knowledge of this conventional type?,3,4
10323,17712124,"One possible answer is that the stored knowledge should not be of the conventional type at all, but should itself be expressed in intensional logic.",25,26
10324,17712124,"Another possible answer is that the intensional logic translations of input sentences should be postprocessed to yield translations expressed in the lowerorder, more conventional logic of the system's knowledge base.",7,8

10326,17712124,"Suppose, for a moment, that people communicated in first-order logic.",13,14
10327,17712124,In intensional logic the nonreferential reading of the first sentence would simply be ((looks-for t ^(a v unicornt)) ^Johnt).,2,3
10328,17712124,"Also, sentences such as ""John frequently dreams about a certain unicorn"" (based on an example in Dowty, Wall and Peters 1981) seem to be untranslatable into any logic without recourse to imaginary entities.",33,34
10329,17712124,"This is not the case for the intensional logic translation of (3) analogous to that of (1), a fact that led Bennett to regard ""worships"" -correctly, we think -as extensional (Bennett 1974 ).",8,9
10330,17712124,"For such adjectives we might employ the semantic rule ~. All of the above rules, as well as our versions of the remaining rules in Gazdar (1981a) , are as simple as the intensional logic versions or simpler.",37,38
10331,17712124,The former uses a recursive descent algorithm and generates intensional logic translations.,10,11
10332,17712124,We have attempted to show that the advantages of Gazdar's approach to grammar can be secured without commitment to an intensional target logic for the translations of natural language sentences.,23,24
10333,17712124,"To motivate this endeavour, we have argued that there are philosophical and practical reasons for preferring a conventional target logic, and that there are as yet no compelling reasons for abandoning such logics in favour of intensional ones.",20,21
10334,17926487,"We describe a system of reversible grammar in which, given a logic-grammar specification of a natural language, two efficient PROLOG programs are derived by an off-line compilation process: a parser and a generator for this language.",12,13
10335,17926487,"The parser will translate well-formed expression of the source language into expressions of the language of ""semantic"" representation, such as regularized operator-argument forms, or formulas in logic.",34,35
10336,17926487,We note that the present version of INVERSE can operate only upon the declarative specification of a logic grammar and is not prepared to deal with extra-logical control operators such as the cut.,17,18

10338,17436634,"The first section discusses general issues concerning the use of first-order logic or the h-calculus to represent meanings, The second section describes how h-calculus meaning representations can be constructed and manipulated directly in Prolog.",13,14

10343,17436634,"There is a mapping from intensional logic to a subset of a typed h-calculus [Gallin 1975 ], [Clifford 1981 ] that shows they are essentially equivalent in expressive power.",6,7
10344,17436634,"Each of the FOL systems, given a declarative sentence as input, produces a well-formed formula in a first-order logic to represent the meaning of the sentence.",24,25
10345,17436634,"This means, in general, that the meanings of subsentential phrases are not given a semantles by first-order model theory; the meanings of intermediate phrases are (as far as traditional first-order logic is concerned) merely uninterpreted data structures.",38,39
10346,17436634,First-order logic is not quite expressive enough to represent directly the meanings of the categories of phrases that can be subcomponents of sentences.,3,4
10347,17436634,"In systems based on first-order logic, this limitation is handled by explicitly constructing fragments of formulas, with extra notation to indicate how they must later combine with other fragments to form a true first-order formula that correctly represents the meaning of the entire sentence.",7,8
10348,17436634,~tamorphosis ~rammars [Colmerauer 197g ] and Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs) [Pereira and ICarren 1980] are essentially conventions for representing grammars as logic programs.,27,28
10349,17436634,This ability to go from a meaning formula back to an English phrase that would produce it is one of the attractive properties of logic grammars.,24,25
10350,17436634,The logic grammars would look even simpler because the ireduce predicate would not need to be explicitly included in each grammar rule.,1,2
10351,17436634,We pointed out how one advantage of the typed l-calculus over first-order logic is its ability to represent directly meanings of phrases of all syntactic cateBories.,16,17
10352,17436634,We then showed how we could implement in Prolog a logic grammar using the l-calculus as the meaning representation languaEe.,10,11
10353,17436634,Finally we discussed the possibility and some of the implications of trying to include part of the l-calculus in the logic programming system itself.,22,23
10354,26732443,H Blocking Potential Misapplication of Default Rules Default reasoning is usually studied in the context of a logical system in its own right or an agent who reasons about the world from partial information and hence may draw conclusions unsupported by traditional logic.,42,43
10355,33357969,"Theoretical Background Generalized Quantifier Theory Quantification has been studied extensively in logic (Frege, 1879; Tarski, 1936; Mostowski, 1957; Lindström, 1966) ; in linguistics (Higginbotham & May, 1981 : Keenan & Stavi, 1986; Zwarts, 1984; Partee, 1988; Szabolcsi, 2010; Ruys & Winter, 2011) , in formal semantics (Montague, 1974; Barwise & Cooper, 1981; van Benthem, 1984; Westerstahl, 1985; Kamp & Reyle, 1993) , and in computational semantics (Alshawi, 1990; Bos, 1995; Pulman, 2000; Robaldo, 2014) .",11,12
10356,33357969,"In logic, the study of quantification and its role in formal reasoning has long (from Aristotle to Tarski) been restricted to the use of the universal (∀, ""for all"") and existential (∃, ""for some"") quantifiers.",1,2
10357,33357969,"According to the theory of generalized quantifiers (GQT), words like all and some in English, as well as their equivalents in other languages, do not form the counterparts of the universal and existential quantifiers of formal logic, and neither do words like three, and most, which have been called 'cardinal quantifiers' and 'proportional quantifiers' (Partee, 1988) , form the counterparts of certain generalized quantifiers.",41,42
10358,33357969,"In formal logic, quantifications are expressions like ∀x.p and ∃x.p, which say that p is true of all individual objects in the universe of discourse and of at least one such object, respectively.",2,3
10359,33357969,"The English expressions that are closest to the universal and existential quantifiers of formal logic are ""everything, something"", and ""everybody, somebody"" (and similarly in other languages), but these expressions do not quantify over all entities, but only over things and persons, respectively.",14,15

10363,33357969,There is no way to represent this second reading without explicitly introducing events; (14a) and (14b) show how the two readings can be represented in first-order logic by assigning alternative relative scopes to the quantifications over events and participants: In the annotation in (15) the relative scope of events and participants is marked up by means of the attribute 'eventScope' that has been added to the XML element <srLink> from ISO 24617-4.,33,34

Using moreover the notation R 0 to indicate the characteristic function of a reference domain that forms a subset of a source domain with characteristic function R, the interpretation of ( 16 ) can be represented in second-order predicate logic as follows: The distributivity of a quantification is not a property of the set of participants in a set of events, but a property of the way of participating.",179,180

13371,247998070,"On the other hand, the relationship between coherence relations and logic has also been the subject of extensive study (e.g., Asher & Lascarides, 2003; Danlos, 2008; González & Ribas, 2008; Groenendijk, 2009; Hobbs, 1979 Hobbs, , 1985;; Marcu, 2000; Potter, 2019 Potter, , 2020 Potter, , 2021;; Sanders, Spooren, & Noordman, 1992; Wong, 1986) .",11,12

13373,247998070,"Theoretical Background The fundamental bases for this work are Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), relational propositions, and the logic of relational propositions.",21,22
13374,247998070,"So the full relational proposition of the text under examination is interpretation (concession(4,5) , elaboration(evidence(3,2),1)) which expands to the logical expression: (((((((((3 → 2) ∧ 3) → 2) → 1) ∧ (((3 → 2) ∧ 3) → 2)) → 1) → (((¬(4 → ¬5) → 5) ∧ ¬(4 → ¬5)) → 5)) ∧ ((((((3 → 2) ∧ 3) → 2) → 1) ∧ (((3 → 2) ∧ 3) → 2)) → 1)) → (((¬(4 → ¬5) → 5) ∧ ¬(4 → ¬5)) → 5)) The evidence and concession predicates specify a Boolean domain of acceptance, elaboration of clarification, interpretation of illumination or insight, and the overarching logic is one of coherence rather than truth.",172,173
13375,247998070,Thus the logic of discursive coherence subsumes the Boolean domains of rhetorical relations.,2,3
13376,247998070,Note that this differs from Potter's (2019) description of the logic of CIRCUMSTANCE as subject matter implicative: (s ∧ (n ∧ (s → n))).,13,14
13377,247998070,"Its logic is therefore modus ponens, (((s → n) ∧ s) → n).",1,2
13378,247998070,"Either way, the logic is the same.",4,5
13379,247998070,Conclusion The possibility that relational propositions might support an alignment of discourse with propositional logic appears to have occurred to Mann and Thompson in their development of RST.,14,15
13380,247998070,"However, the logic of relational propositions maps readily from their original vision.",3,4
13381,247998070,"While this multiplicity of Boolean domains is, so far as I know, a novel concept for argument mining, applications of Boolean logic beyond truth functional domains are by no means new, having an extensive history in circuit design, set theory, digital logic, and database query languages.",24,25

13383,213344018,This relational complex can be transformed into a logical expression using the logic of relational propositions.,12,13
13384,213344018,The expression can then be generalized as a logical signature for use in logic-mining discourse for instances of the rule.,13,14
13385,213344018,"A method for doing so would be valuable for natural language processing, discourse analysis, and studies in logic and argumentation.",19,20
13386,213344018,Identifying relational complexes associated with these rules will support the specification of generalized logical signatures that can be used in logic-mining texts.,20,21
13387,213344018,"While the method defined here is limited to modus tollens and its variants, it provides guidance for investigating other rules of inference, such as hypothetical syllogism and dilemma, and may lead to a general methodology for signature-based logic mining.",42,43
13388,213344018,This also suggests the possibility of discovering rules of inference present in discourse but not recognized in the literature of classical logic.,21,22
13389,213344018,"Lest there be any confusion as to the scope of this study, note that the objective here is not to develop a system of reasoning based on linguistic form, as in natural logic (MacCartney & Manning, 2009; Van Benthem, 1986) , nor is it concerned with the logical forms of imperatives, questions, and statements, nor with the relationship between grammar and reasoning (Lakoff, 1970) .",34,35

13394,213344018,"Granted, there are persuasive arguments in favor of treating condition as biconditional (e.g., Geis & Zwicky, 1971; Horn, 2000; Karttunen, 1971; Moeschler, 2018; van der Auwera, 1997a van der Auwera, , 1997b)) ; however, for the purpose of logic mining the biconditional interpretation of condition will frequently be unnecessary, and preserving the distinction conditional and biconditional can be a useful.",54,55
13395,213344018,"Although it is common practice present logic in terms of truth values and truth functions, these semantics are arbitrary, and we could just as well speak of on and off, + and -, 1 and 0, yes and no, open and closed, satisfiability and unsatisfiability, or any other bivalent conceptualization, including belief and disbelief, positive and negative regard, desire and indifference, interest and disinterest, understanding and misunderstanding, or ability and inability.",6,7
13396,213344018,"However, the logic differs from the previous example, due to the use of the cause predicate instead of condition.",3,4
13397,213344018,Conclusion This exploration of modus tollens has shown how relational propositions can be used to support discourse logic-mining using logical signatures as a means for discovering occurrences of standard rules of inference in discourse.,17,18
13398,213344018,"By basing the concept of logic-mining on a theory of coherence relations, it is by definition constrained to discursive inferences discoverable within a text.",5,6
