639,51997874,"Since each icon is accompanied by metadata containing humanedited synonym lists, it was natural to represent icons as some composition of their synonyms in a vector space.",2,3
640,51997874,"In this manner, we embedded our icons in text, and created pseudo-sequences (""icon sentences"").",18,19
641,51997874,"This solution is not without problems, first among them the issue is that our icon sentences may not represent realistic examples of how the Symbolstix icons are meant to be used.",15,16
642,51997874,"For example comparing a possible icon sequence to the English language might look like: Icon: <I> <go> <here> <past> English: <I> <went> <here>, or English: <the> <dogs> <are> <at> <home> Icon: <the> <dog> <plural> [<be> optional] <at> <home> Some of the terms may disappear in translation, while others are added.",5,6
