235,149876412,"In synchronic research, the dimensions and personae in the spaces can be constructed based on experimental data, as in (Douven, 2016) , and the indexical fields associated with sociolinguistic variants can likewise be determined by experimentation (see, for instance, (Campbell-Kibler, 2007; Levon, 2014; Podesva et al.,",29,30
236,149876412,"The study that we are modeling in this paper is a historical one, and it's possible that g-gender's indexical fields have changed in the past twenty years.",23,24
237,149876412,"Function nouns and indexical fields The nouns that alternate in the Assemblée Nationale corpus all refer to very powerful government positions (ministre, garde des sceaux, président(e) etc.).",3,4
238,149876412,"We propose that grammatical gender marking (M/F) also picks out regions: the space associated with all the personae that have a high level of at least one of the properties in the indexical field (Burnett, 2017) .",37,38
239,149876412,"In the two-dimensional projections of Figures 5 and 6 , this is materialized by the horizontal blue lines: all and only individuals above those lines are in the masculine indexical field.",32,33
240,149876412,"Following the analysis in (4), the social meaning of feminine g-gender corresponds to the concave region associated with all the personae that are lower than the first quartile on the dimensions in the indexical field.",38,39

242,149876412,"The ideological structure in 1986 is such that the space picked out by the indexical field of the feminine is disjoint from JministreK: in both Figure 5 and Figure 6 , the rectangle to the right of the red line and below the blue line is empty.",14,15
243,149876412,"Keeping the same definitions as in the 1986 model, we see that these new personae change the denotation of ministre and the indexical fields of M and F. Firstly, JministreK now has more polygons of personae in its denotation.",23,24
244,149876412,"Secondly, some of these ministers stand within the indexical field of the feminine, because they are very sensitive or pragmatic (Figure 8 ).",9,10
245,149876412,"As shown in Table 3 , since there are no ministers who are located within the indexical field of la, P 86 (v(p)|la) = 0, for all p 2 JministreK 86 .",16,17
246,149876412,This is due to the fact in (8-a): the regions picked out by the feminine's indexical field are disjoint from where the ministers lie.,20,21
247,2628500,"Adverbs derived from indexical and comparative expressions are other common devices capable of attributing the highest degree (Bolinger, 1972) (Tab.1 #6), as well as the large class of multiword adverbs (Tab.1 #7), and the so-called prototypical comparisons (Guil, 2006) -formally similative constructions relating two entities, one of which is prototypical with respect to a particular property, and in which the comparison with a prototype triggers a hyperbolizing, and thus superlativizing, interpretation (Tab.1 #8).",3,4
248,5487802,"We view constituents as referential, or better, indexical; we link elementary trees with constraints on these indices and conjoin the constraints in the meaning of a compound structure.",9,10

251,17953740,"When people, objects, locations or other elements are verbalized outside the net of relationships found in clauses, they are often pointed at through speech, and the manner can be said to be 'indexical'.",37,38
