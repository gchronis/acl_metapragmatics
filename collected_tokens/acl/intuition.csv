4787,17599432,Participles in the Parallel Corpus The intuition of the cross-lingual induction approach is that adverbial participles can easily be extracted from parallel corpora since in other languages (such as English or French) adverbs are often morphologically marked and easily labelled by statistical PoS taggers.,6,7
4788,17599432,This result confirms our initial intuition that the property of being used as an adverb is strongly lexically restricted to a certain class of participles.,5,6

4831,991024,Cross-Lingual Induction of Adverbial Participles The intuition of the cross-lingual induction approach is that adverbial participles can be easily extracted from parallel corpora since in other languages (such as English or French) adverbs are often morphologically marked and easily labelled by statistical PoS taggers.,8,9
4832,991024,Syntax-based Filtering The intuition behind the filters presented in this section is that adverbial translations which are due to cross-lingual divergences can be identified on the basis of their syntactic contexts.,5,6

4846,18310837,The system exploits the intuition that a highly compositional collocation would tend to have a considerable semantic overlap with its constituents (headword and modifier) whereas a collocation with low compositionality would share little semantic content with its constituents.,4,5
4847,18310837,This intuition is operationalised via three configurations that exploit cosine similarity measures to detect the semantic overlap between the collocation and its constituents.,1,2
4848,18310837,"If y is the headword of a collocation and coll(p) is a Boolean function that determines whether the word at position p forms a collocation with x, let W x (y) = ∑ p (1 if doc(p) = y coll(p, x) , else 0) • C 1 (p) (6) be the word vector computed from all the occurrences of the headword y that form a collocation with x and conversely, let W x(y) = ∑ p (1 if doc(p) = y coll(p, x) , else 0) • C 1 (p) (7) be the word vector representing the occurrences of y not engaging in a collocation with x. In this configuration, the compositionality score is then computed by c 2 = cos W x (y) , W x (y) (8) The intuition behind this configuration is that if the headword tends to co-occur with more or less the same words in both cases (producing a high cosine score), then the meaning of the headword is similar regardless of whether the collocation's modifier is present or not, implying a high degree of compositionality.",160,161

11450,685345,"Using a Part-Of-Speech Distortion Model: The intuition behind this model is that using the POS tag can be useful to predict the reordering of sentences, and that those statistics would be less sparse and more informative than only based in words. •",11,12
11451,685345,Using several Language Models: The intuition in this experience was to add a POS language model in the model to penalize sentences with uncommon POS sequences.,6,7
11452,208267772,"Here, the principle is based on the intuition that the keyword is the most informative word in the full-sentence answer, and contains the information that is not included in the question (i.e., the concise answer).",8,9
11453,2511307,"The general intuition for WSD is that words with similar context have the same sense (Charniak, 1993; Lin, 1997) .",2,3
11454,218674232,"Those findings not only provide some interesting insights of word embeddings but also fit nicely with our intuition, which further proves RPD as a suitable measure to quantify the relationship between different sets of word embeddings.",17,18
11455,216035781,We introduce an axiom that follows from the intuition that for a normalized DNN every input feature contributes as much to a specific class as it detracts from all other classes.,8,9
11456,235098226,We first conclude two necessary conditions of its occurrence based on the intuition of exposure bias in literature in Section 3.4.,12,13
11457,235098226,The above observations satisfy the intuition of exposure bias that mistakes are made in the early stage and are amplified afterward.,5,6
11458,227905197,"Our intuition is that such moves would further improve the final outcome by several BLEU points, but due to time constraints we chose not to go forward with them.",1,2
11459,883074,"All in all, it is shown that a word embedding and neural network based singleton detection system can perform as well as a learner based on hand-crafted, linguistic-intuition-based features.",33,34
11460,235097571,The intuition behind using relations annotated as adverse effect to detect cause relations between food and disease entities is that one would use similar sentence structures to describe a disease occurring as a result of the ingestion of a particular drug or food.,1,2
11461,235097571,The intuition behind this approach is that we can reformulate the task Does sequence X express relation Y?,1,2
11462,248780091,"First, perhaps contrary to intuition, ML can outperform IAA when annotator classification func-IAA, it is not immediately obvious how to better parameterize misspecification, and in any case, we don't think this property affects our conclusions.",5,6
11463,250390676,"The intuition is that a trivial and safe response is likely to appear frequently in different contexts and would usually contain less specific words, causing the inverse model to struggle to retrieve the source query from it, thus resulting in a higher loss.",1,2
11464,14195818,"Our intuition is that the ability of word embeddings to capture semantic and syntactic knowledge, as well as the ability of LSTM to capture word dependencies are the contributing factors to this.",1,2
11465,222303691,This matches our intuition: in the two extreme cases where k = 0 and where k is the document length (corresponding to a full bag-of-words classifier) the message has no information about how the classifier C behaves.,3,4
11466,231951320,"The results of the submitted XGBoost ensemble model stand proof that our intuition was correct, namely that all these individual models have the potential to complement each other if put together in an ensemble.",12,13
11467,5090230,The mechanical turk compares the answer templates with the user's answer and provides a score that represents how close the two are according to the turk's intuition.,28,29
11468,222291117,"On the other hand, plausibility is of lesser concern, because a model developer aims to understand and possibly improve the model, and that model does not necessarily align with human intuition (see Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020b, for a detailed discussion of the differences between faithfulness and plausibility).",33,34
11469,12164644,We train our answer generator using the following intuition: a question can be asked in several different ways.,8,9
11470,12164644,"We use the intuition that a post p i , when updated with the answer a i that it is paired with in our dataset, would be more complete than if it is updated with some other answer a j .",3,4
11471,235732335,Our intuition is that the remaining hybrid models are SCAN-tailored and would not lead to any improvement in the low-resource (FloRes) and domain-shifted (Nounadjective ordering dataset) settings.,1,2
11472,235732335,"In this section, we verify our intuition and report the results of all the introduced variants.",7,8
11473,235097526,"5 The intuition here is that the multilingual model may be able to encode useful information about the source language, terms that should be copied (e.g., names/numbers), target grammar, or other useful topics, and can then be specialized for a specific language, while still retaining the most relevant or most general things learned from all languages trained on.",2,3
11474,21008994,"Our intuition is that by utilizing self-training method, the effort to label semantic roles will reduce substantially.",1,2
