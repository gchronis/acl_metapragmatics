4000,243865222,Sufficiency A desired property of a good rationale is sufficiency.,7,8
4001,243865222,This imposes the model predictions about the task label considering the entire input text to be similar to the predictions made by looking at only the rationale text.,26,27
4002,243865222,"This concept can be promptly translated into an objective function by resorting to a consistency objective: L suf f (p S ) = E − log p S (y = y T |u r T )) , (4) where the expectation is taken w.r.t u ∼ D u , r T ∼ p T (r|u), y T ∼ p T (y|u) and u r T is the masked version of document u in which tokens that are not part of the rationale (as predicted by the teacher) are replaced with a special [MASK] token.",92,93
4003,243865222,"Here, the teacher model looks at the full input and the student model looks only at the rationale tokens.",18,19
4004,243865222,The sufficiency loss can be interpreted as an alternative way of integrating rationale information in the model.,12,13
4005,243865222,"Current efforts either predict the rationale first and then use it for task prediction sequentially as in BERT-to-BERT (DeYoung et al.,",5,6
4006,243865222,"2020) ; or employ attention regularization such that the BERT attention weights are as close as possible to uniform on the rationale tokens (Pruthi et al.,",22,23
4007,243865222,The first approach can be very sensitive to error propagation from the rationale generator since the task label is predicted using only the generated rationales at test-time.,12,13
4008,243865222,The second approach strictly assumes uniform attention on the rationale tokens.,9,10
4009,243865222,"In contrast, our sufficiency loss makes very few assumptions on how the model should attend to the rationale tokens, and only requires the student distribution of the task labels to be similar to that of the teacher.",18,19
4010,243865222,"This yields more robustness to rationale errors, given that at test-time our model can use the full input to predict the task label.",5,6
4011,243865222,Completeness Another desiderata of a rationale is completeness.,5,6
4012,243865222,Completeness implies that the rationale should capture all the aspects in the input text that are predictive of the task label.,4,5
4013,243865222,We translate this concept by requiring the student model to be maximally uncertain of the task label if it does not look at the rationale i.e. by masking out the teacher-predicted rationale tokens in the input text: L comp (p S ) = E − H(p S (y|u (1 − r T ))) (5) where the expectation is w.r.t.,24,25

4519,8177091,"The rationale behind their procedure is that the phoneme, or grapheme, sequence within a morpheme is completely restricted, while at a morpheme boundary any number of new morphemes (many with different initial phonemes) could occur.",1,2
4520,233296336,"The rationale here is that, to the extent that our swapping preserved the underlying connection between features and class labels, this should show up directly in the performance of the BoW model.",1,2

4526,233365334,"Here, it should also be noted that the training corpus used to achieve this score was almost half the size of the one used by IndicFast-Text, further supporting our rationale of fine-tuning.",33,34

4528,222303691,Our fundamental assumption is that explainability is intimately linked to the ability of an explainer to communicate the rationale of a decision in terms that can be understood by a human; we use the success of this communication as a criterion for how plausible the explanation is.,18,19
