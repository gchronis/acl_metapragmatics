3510,201678668,"Second, there are approaches where distributional features are used as input to systems that create symbolic representations, e.g. Banarescu et al. (",16,17
3511,201678668,These are phenomena to which more symbolic/structural approaches are well suited.,6,7
3512,201678668,"Unlike most symbolic meaning representations, GKR does not attempt to push all aspects of meaning into a single uniform logical notation.",2,3
3513,201678668,These two main principles are exactly how GKR lends itself to the blending of structural/symbolic and distributional features.,16,17
3514,201678668,"This shows how the ""basic"" predicate-argument compositionality (concept graph) and the ""harder"" compositionality (context graph) can be kept apart and foreshadows our proposals: the method of factoring out the ""harder"" compositionality can lead to better performance for both the symbolic/structural and the distributional systems.",52,53
3515,201678668,"Our proposal for extension of GKR The two core principles of GKR, i.e. the strict separation of concepts and contexts, with sentence words representing concepts and not individuals, and the modularity and layer separation of the information, allow us to formulate our proposal for a hybrid meaning representation with symbolic/structural and distributional features.",53,54
3516,201678668,"In this section we show how GKR allows for two different ways of combining symbolic/structural and distributional meaning features, each way involving a different degree of the contribution of each kind of feature and thus being freely select-able based on the needs of the researcher and of the given application.",14,15
3517,201678668,More symbolic This proposal is the closest to the original proposal of Kalouli and Crouch (2018) because it only expands the current lexical graph of GKR but keeps all other linguistic structures in place.,1,2
3518,201678668,"In that sense, it is more symbolic/structural than it is distributional: it exploits the distributional strengths for the conceptual meaning of the words but builds both the ""basic"" (predicate-argument) compositionality as well as the ""harder"" compositionality phenomena in a symbolic/structural way.",7,8
3519,201678668,"In that sense, it is more symbolic/structural than it is distributional: it exploits the distributional strengths for the conceptual meaning of the words but builds both the ""basic"" (predicate-argument) compositionality as well as the ""harder"" compositionality phenomena in a symbolic/structural way.",51,52
3520,201678668,"It also integrates a learning process in the match update, but in its core, it solves the ""basic"" predicate-argument as well as the ""harder"" boolean/contextual compositionality with symbolic/structural methods, namely through the use of the concept and context graphs.",37,38
3521,201678668,"No matter the predicate-argument composition approach and the final distributional representation, what is crucial is that Boolean and contextual phenomena can be treated outside this representation and thus distributional approaches can benefit from the precision that symbolic/structural methods achieve in such phenomena.",39,40
3522,201678668,"Future work can apply the proposed method to the other sets, some of which however, e.g. the scrambled word order sets, might need a stronger symbolic/structural component as presented in our first proposal in Section 4.1.",28,29
3523,201678668,"Then, if the contexts assigned to the concepts and thus the computed representations are correct, the system can still predict the correct relation because it can use the matched representations of the distributional approach and their instantiability of the symbolic/structural approach.",41,42
3524,201678668,This means that we benefit from the robustness of the distributional approaches without sacrificing the precision of the symbolic/structural ones.,18,19
3525,201678668,Testing this approach with further datasets of complex examples can show potential weaknesses of using GKRs in this way and particularly highlight other aspects where the distributional or the symbolic/structural strengths should be used more or less.,29,30
3526,201678668,"For example, as indicated above, testing with sets with scrambled word order pairs (e.g. The dog is licking the man vs. The man is licking the dog) might show the need for a stronger symbolic/structural component where the predicateargument structure is considered more, as it is done in the first proposed approach in 4.1.",38,39
