, we deal m tins paper wttb the issue of producmg a summary from an arbitrary text without reqmrmg zts full understanding, but using wtdely avadable knowledge sources Our mare goal is therefore to find a middle ground for source representation, rich enough to braid quality indicative summaries, but easy enough to extract from the source text to work on arbltrary text Over-slmphficatlon can harm the quahty of the source representation As a trivial illustration, consider the following two sequences Collocation relations are more problematzc for ld-enttticat~on than rezterat|on, but both of t~hese categones are Identifiable on the surface oi~ the text Lextcal cohemon occurs not only between two terms, but among sequences of related words ~ called/ez-~cal chains (Morns and Hlrst, 1991) Lemcal chains provide a representahon of the lemcal cohemve structare of the text Lemcal chains have also been used for mfo~nahon retrieval (Stamnand, 1996) and for correction ofmalaproptsms (Htrst and St-Onge, 1997 (to appear)) In tlus paper, we mveshgate how lemcal chmns can be used as a source representation for summarization Another nnportant dunenmon of the lmgumtzc structure of a source ,text m captured under the related not,on of coherence Coherence defines the macro-level semantic structure of a connected dLscourse, while cohesion creates connectedness m a non-structural manner Coherence m represented m terms of coherence relat~ous between text segments, such as cla~orahon, cause and ezplanat|on Some researchers, e g, (Ono, Kazuo, and Seljl, 1994) , use chscourse structure (encoded umng RST (MAnn and Thompson, 1987) as a source representatxon for summanzatxon) Clearly, thin representation ms expresmve enough, the question m whether ~t m computable In contrast to lemcal cohemon, coherence m chfl~cult to zdent|fy mthout complete understandmg of the text and complex reference In ad&tton, there m no prease criteria for clasmficat~on of differ-ent relatlous Consider the following example from Hobbs(1978) ""John can open the safe He Imows the combmahon "" (Morns and H~mt, 1991) show that the relation between these two sentences can he interpreted as daborahon or as ezplanahon, depen&ng on %ontext, knowledge and behefs"" There m, however, a close connechon between dincourse structure and cohemon Related words tend to co-occur mthm a dmcourse umt of the text So cohemon m one of the surface mgns of dmcourse structure and lexlcal chaln~ can' be used to Identify it Other mgns can be used to ldentzfy dmcourse structure as well (connect,yes, paragraph markers, tense shifts) In thls paper, we investigate the use oflemcal chains as a model of the source text for the purpose of producing a summary Obviously, other pects of the source text need to be integrated m the text representation to produce quahty summaries, but we want to empmcally investigate how far one can go exploiting mainly lemcal chains In the rest of the paper we first present our algorithm for lexzeal chain construct,on We then present empmcal results on the ldentlficatzon of strong chains among the posmble can&dates produced by our algorithm Finally, we describe how lexlcal chains are used to identify mgmficant sentences mtlnn the source text and eventually produce a surQmary Algorithm for Chain Computing One of the clnef advantages of lemcal cohesmn m that zt m an easdy reco~m~able relatmn, enabhng lexlcal chains computation The first computational model for lemcal chains was presented m (Morns and Hlrst, 1991) They define lexlcal cohesmn relatzons m terms of categories, index entries and pointers m Roget's Thesaurus Morns and Hlrst evaluated that their relatedness criterion covered over 90% of the mtmttve lexzcal relatzons Cham~ are created by taking a new text word and findtng a related chain for it according to relatedness criteria Morns and HLrst introduce the notion of ""actzvated chain ~ and ~cham returns"", to take into account the dmtance between occurrences of related words They also analyze factors contributing to the strength of a chain --repetltxon, density and length Morns and Hn'st &d not ~nplement their algorithm, because there was no machine-readable vermon of Roget's Thesaurus at the tzme One of the drawbacks of thelr approach was that they chd not reqmre the same word to appear ruth the same sense m ~ts &ffexent occurrences for tt to belong to a chain For semantically ambiguous words, this can lead to confnslous (e g, mixing two senses of taSle as aptece 0f furniture or an array) Note that choosing the appropriate chain for a word is eqmvalent to dzsamblguatmg tins word m context, which is a well-known d~fl~cult problem m text understanding More recently, two algorithms for the calculation of lexlcal chains have been presented m Hirst and St-Onge (1995) and Stairmand (1996) Both of these algornthms use the WordNet lexlcal database for determining relatedness of the words (Miller et al, 1990) Senses m the WordNet database are represented relatlonally by synonym sets ('synsets') -which are the sets of all the words sharing a common sense For example two senses of ""computer"" are represented as {calculator, reckoner, figurer, estimator, computer) (s e, a person who computes) and {computer, data processor, electromc computer, reformation processing system) WordNet contains more than 118,000 dflferent word forms Words of the same category are hnked through semantic relations hke synonymy and hyponymy Polysemous words appear m more than one synsets (for example, comptdcr occurs m two synsets) Approxtmately 17% of the words m WordNet are polysemous But, as noted by Stairmand, this figure is very tmsleadmg ""a slguxficant proportion of WordNet nouns are Latin labels for biological entitles, which by their nature are monosemons and our experience wtth the news-report texts we have processed ts that approxtmately half of the nouns encountered are polysemous"" (Stairmand, 1996) Generally, a procedure for constructing lexlcal chains follows three steps (1) Select a set of can&date words, (2) For each candldate word, find an appropriate chain relying on a relatedness cute.on among members of the chains, (3) If It is found, insert the word m the chain and update It accorchngly An example of such a procedure was represented by Hlrst and St-Onge (H&S) In the preprocessor step, all words that appear as a noun entry m Word-Net are chosen Relatedness of words xs dstermmed m terms of the distance between their occurrences and the shape of the path connecting them m the WordNet thesaurus Three kinds of relation are defined extra-strong (between a word and tts rep-etxt~on), strong (between two words connected by a Wordnet relatxon) and mechum-stroug when the hnk between the synsets of the words is longer than one (only paths satisfying certain restrictions are accepted as vahd connectxons) The maxtmum distance between related words depends on the kind of relatxon for extra-strong relattons, there is not hxmt m &stance, for strong rela-tlons, it is hmlted to a window of seven sentences, and for mechum-strong relations, It is wltinn three sentences back To find a chain m winch to insert a given candtdate word, extra-strong relattons are preferred to strong-relations and both of them are preferred to medmm-strong relations If a chain is found, then the candtdate word is inserted with the appropriate sense, and the senses of the other words m the receiving chain are updated, so that every word connected to the new word m the chain relates to Its selected senses only If no chaan is found, then a new chain Is created and the can&date word ts inserted with all its possible senses m WordNet The greedy &samblguatzon strategy Implemented m this algorithm has some lmntatlonsdinstrated by the following example Mr. Kenny ~s the person that invented an anaesthehc machine whsch uses micro-computers to control the rate

building computational semantic lexlcons which are used by Natural Language Processmg (NLP) systems comes from Mlkrokosmos, a knowledge-based machine translation system, 1 where texts from Spanish and

mterhngua structure The lexicons built for Mlkrokosmos are multipurpose multlhngual to support translation or multflmgual generatmn tasks, reusable, that is, apphcable to several NLP tasks~ (e g, generation, analysis, information extraction), and maintainable, that Is, supporting semi-automatic acquisition and restructuring of the lexicons The content of the Lexlcal Knowledge Base (LKB) ~s essentially the same ~rrespective of a particular application The types of information important for analysis and generation might differ, as suggested by Dale and Melhsh (1998) For instance, recording all the senses of a lexeme is more important for analysis than generation, conversely, knowing styhstlc mformation on words such as hzghfalutm or formal m 1For a descnptmn of Mlkrokosmos, see http//crl nmsu edu/Research/Projects/nukro/mdex html important for generation (Hovy, 1988) The content of a multl-purpose LKB is apphcatlon Independent (modulo its indexing m analysis the LKB Is Indexed on lexemes whereas for generation the LKB is indexed on concepts) We argue, m section 2 that the acquisition process ~s apphcatmn-dependent Moleover we argue that defining the meamng of a word for NLP systems requires a training-intensive effolt In other words, the fact that we, as humans, understand texts does not entail that we can determine the ""computational"" meaning of a word Chomsklan trees are linguists' constructs, not Innate structures A hngmst must be trained to be able to build syntactic patterns (e g, trees) In computational semantics, the same rule applies one must be trained to build the corresponding semantics (e g frames, predicates, ) for a word In order to approach the ""computational"" meaning of a word, training Is the most important means we have to date to ensure consistency among acquuers Other means are to adopt an overt semantics with a machine-guided approach which directs as much as possible the acqulrer (Section 3) This machine guided approach could also act behind the ' back"" of an acquner ""correcting ~' some mc0nslstencms m lexmal descnptlons between acqmrers, as will be shown m Sectmn 6 In Section 4, we &scuss our use of off the shelf lesources, such as WordNet (Miller, 1990) , to accelerate the machine-graded acqmsltlon of the Enghsh lexicon by taking advantage of the existing database of synsets 2 whmh provide synonym lists for a lexeme We also show how a semantic-based approach, can help predict the syntactic behavior of words Note that the reverse (predicting semantms from syntax) is not true, as some experiments on Levm's work (1993) have shown (Sectmn 4) In Sectmn 5, we address mulUlmgual issues in lexicon development 2 Application-driven Acquisition The semantics of an entry is an underspecffied Text Meaning Representation (TMR) fragment (e g, De-fnse and Nlrenburg, 1991) Th,s TMR fragment can be a concept from the ontology or some lnterhngua structures such as att,tudes, modahtms, aspects, sets and TMR relatmns (addltion, enumeratlon, compamson) Concepts and lnterhngua structures can appear together or independently The ontology, to which lexemes are mapped, conmsts of concepts (named sets of property-value pairs) organized hlerarchmally along subsumptlon hnks, w~th an average of 14 relational hnks (such as ISA, SUBCLASS, AGENT, THEME-OF, HEADED-BY, HAS-MEMBER) per concept (Mahesh, 1996) In a multflmgual enwronment, the main practical advantage of connectmg the lexlcon to an ontology is cost-effect,veness, as only the ""language-dependent"" propertms have tO be acquired when adding new natural laffh~iages to the system The mapping between a word and the ontology is the most difficult task of lexicon acquisition, and requires to develop the most cost-effective approach in terms of trmmng and strategms 2 1 Importance of Training The expemment reported below shows that training is essential to determine the ""computational"" meanmg of a word A native spea]~er of Spanish, who had not taken part m the lexacon traanmg process, was asked to add some senses to entries m the Spanish lexicon Thls was mainly done for testing the analyzer, as there were only 23 out of 167 words which were ambiguous m one text we were analyzing But we also d~scovered thls was a very useful exercise for testing the quahty of a semantic lexicon The list of added senses was reviewed by two computational hngmsts, one in charge of supervising the training and the other with proficiency m our framework who had seen entries as they were used by the analyzer but had not taken part to the training process either The untrained acqmrer, hereafter UN-ACQ, added a total of 111 to 55 open class words or so Among these 55 words where ambiguity had been added, 33 were already ambiguous in the Spanzsh lexicon After a closer look at the Spanish lexicon, and at the senses retrieved by the semantic analyzer, and after doing an on-hne corpora search, the computational hngulsts accepted less than 20 new senses among the 111 suggested This ""overge,aeratlor~"" of senses by UNACQ had different origins 1) the analyzer did not present all the senses from the Spanlsh lexicon to UNACQ, it only presented the ones that were accepted after syntactic binding, u) the senses added by UNACQ were ""equivalent"" to the senses already in the Spanish lexicon, but not recogmzed by UNACQ, as they were acquired as ""unspecffied"" in the Spanish lexicon, m) UNACQ hardcoded non-hteral meanings of the words, iv) the addition of senses was MRD-dnven UNACQ acquired the list of meanings provzded by the Spanlsh-Enghsh Larousse and Colhns, adopt,ng an enumeration approach Such a task Is not superficial, it ensures that the quahty of the core lexicon ,s good enough so that it can serve as a basis for lexicon expansion techtuques, some of which we develop below (see Vmgas (1999) for the choices an acqu,rer faces when workmg out the semantic mapping Of a word) Strategms There are mainly two approaches to word sense assignment corpus-dr,yen and mental-driven The former is better adapted to braiding lexicons used m analysis, whereas the latter better suits lexicons to be used in generation We refer to Kllganff (1997) for the corpus-driven approach, and discuss m this paper the mental-driven.approach A mental-driven or thesaurus-drlven approach consists m grouping together lexemes which share the same meaning In order to ensure consistency among acqulrers' mappings we have divided the process of acqu,rmg a coinputatlonal semantic lexicon into two phases preacquisition and acquisition There is still time to revise a pre-acqulred mapping at acquis,tlon time, if needed The Pre-Acquisitmn Phase For a generatmn lexicon, the method of preparing the pre-acqulsltlon files can be as follows 1) extract all concepts from the ontology, n) lexlcahze them usmg on-hne thesauri, dlctlonanes and native speakers' lntultmns, m) order pre-acqulsltion files accordmg to the semantic Mapping-Tag (see below) A pre-acqmmtion record includes 7 fields Semantics, Mapping-Tag, Lexeme, POS, Translations, Fie-quency_, and Polysemy-Count The Semantics field includes only the ontological head concept, in which the word sense should be anchored (no selectlonal restrictions or other ptopertms are specified at this stage) The Mapping-Tag field (see below) describes the type of connectloa between the word sense and its conceptual meanmg some word senses are directly mapped (""dim"" map) to a single concept in the ontology, wheleas the meaning of some other word senses is descllbed through the combination of concepts hnked vm propertles (relations or attributes) We defined seven tags which flag the entry for a specific task For mstance, ""devb"" (deverbal) is used primarily for nouns and adjectives when their meaning is a composition of a filler and an event (e g bombing, readable), ""asp"" (aspecttral) is used for true aspectuals (e g begin) and also with actions expressing aspectuallty (e g stare, duration prolonged) The Translatmns field includes an English translation (for languages other than English) Frequency, POS and polysemy count are extracted automatically, using on-hne large corpora for frequency, and WordNet for • .in mm the part of speech and the polysemy count Bihngum dictionaries, filtered by a native speaker of the foreign language, are used for the translations into English (for the acquisition of languages other than English) In order to increase speed at acqulsitmn time, each acqmrer works on one type of Mapping-Tag at a time For instance, some acqmrers work on type OBJECT Type OBJECT call only be lexlcahzed into nouns, e g DEVICE -+ devzce instrument tool apphance Others work on the type EVENT ~VENTS can be lexlcahzed into nouns, e g EXPLODE --~ bombzn9, bombardment, or into verbs bomb, bombard, drop_bombs_on, throw_bombs_at In order to increase consistency, acquIrers go through specially designed trammg sessions 3 Overt Semantics to Predict Syntax: A Machine-guided Approach Mappings between semantic roles and syntacUc complements axe defined via a mapping (a rule) These mappings can be defined for large sub-classes of lexical entries For example, the rule Atl;-Pred-Adj creates an entry which accepts in the semantic feature a concept from the subtree of ATTRIBUTE or an ATTITUDE and accepts attributive (e g safe car) and predlcat,ve uses (e g the car zs sa]e) In the case of an adjecUve mapped to a RELATION (e g MENTAL-OBJECT-RELATION) the preferred rule would be Att-Adj generating an attributive reading (e g, dental practzce), and not (~the practice ~s dental) By selecting the appropriate mapping for classes of entries, it is possible to hide the mapping from the acqulrer since these mappings are defined in a lexlcal class, not m an instance As defined by an acqulrer, an entry looks as follows [key ""safe"", syn Att-Pred-Adj, sem [name Safety-Attrlbute, range Safe]], During compilation of the dictionary, the Att-Pred-Ad 3 label is replaced with its definition and makes explicit the co-reference between the subcategorization and the semantics So far we have developed for the English lexicon about twenty syntactic patterns whmh apply to a large number of semantic frames In the case of adjectives, we have 3 rules, one for attributive adjectives, another one for predicative adjectives, and a third one for attributive adjective used predicatively In the case of nouns, we have developed four patterns as Illustrated below We presented above the labels of subcategorlzation patterns as they appear at acqms~tlon time At processing time, there is no difference between Obll and Ob12, which are both of type Oblique Our machine-graded approach helps the acqmrer to select a rule as it only presents the relevant ones for a specffic semantic type For instance, in the case of a lexeme mapped to an OBJECT no rules having obliques will be presented to the acqmrer as described below The table above should be read as follows the first column provides type examples for nouns, the second column (semantics) provides the list of semantlc types that a noun can be, Obj (Object), Prop (Property) and Event, the third column (subcategonzation) presents all subcategorizations a noun can subcategorize for, the fourth column (lexlcal class) concatenates the semantics and the subcategorization For instance EventNObjObllObjEventOb12Opt' is the lexmal, class of nouns.which are of.type 'Event' and therefore subcategorlze for two obhques (Obl) -the former must be Obj whereas the latter can be either Obj or Event These Obl can be optional (Opt) Acqmrers may specify the preposition (head of the oblique or preposlUonal phrase) For Instance, in the case of lather, once an acqulrer has mapped the word to the concept ' Father"" which is a Prop (Property) the acquisition tool presents the subcategorizatmn NObllOpt This allows the acquirer to select wluch prepositlon(s) can go with the range of Father (in this case ""of"" will be selected) This Information is important in generation For generation, one must specify, at acquisition tlme, whether or not one can say the bombing o/Iraq , the bombing of Iraq by the US ~ the bombing by the US It also helps in word sense dxsamblguation In the case of verbs, one can also define lexicosyntactic classes for different semantic classes For instance, in the case of ASSERTIVEACT the lexemes mapped to it will accept a comp clause (e g he sazd (that,) he would come) One class of aspectuals subcategonzes for nps (e g I started a new book), xcomps (e g I started reading/Tinting a new book), and accepts the intransitive alternation when the grammatical object is of type Event (e g the surgery started very late) 3 Propagation of Lexicons In this section, we briefly discuss how to extend a lexmon using denvatlonal morphology, and off the shelf resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1990) to propagate the English lexicon with synonyms, and Levm's database of subcategonzatlons and alternations for Enghsh verbs (Levm, 1993) to encode syntactic information m the verb entries 4 Morpho-semantics for Derlvatlonal Morphology We refer the reader to Vmgas et al (1996) for the details on this type of acquisition and theoretical background of Lexlcal Rules (LRs) To sketch this operation briefly, applying morpho semantic LRs to the entry for the Spanish verb comprar (buy), our acquisition system produced automatically 26 new entries (comprador-N1 (buyer), comprable-Ad] (buyable), etc) This includes creating new syntax, semantics and syntax-semantm mappings with correct subcategomzations and also the right semantics For instance, the lexmal entry for comprable will have the subcategonzatlon for predicative and attributive adjectives and the semantics adds the attribute FEA-SIBILITYATTRIBUTE to the basic meaning BuY of comprar (Vmgas et al, 1996) WordNet has been used as follows We extracted the synsets assooated with a lexeme using fuzzy string matches between, on the one hand, the value of the ontological concept (e g, DESIRE), its defimtlon (e g, for DESIRE ""to want something"") and the concept and definition of ~ts corresponding ISA concept (e g, INTEND) and, on the other hand, the direct hypernyms and hyponyms for the lexeme m 3See Vmgas et al (1999) for the details on the web raterfaces used for the acqulsltmn 4See Vlegas et al (1998) for more details WordNet synsets For instance, for the English verb expect, mapped to the ontological concept DESIRE our algorithm only kept one synset hope, expect, trust, deswe for expect and the following synsets for Its hypernyms wzsh, des:re, want The output of our automatlc procedure and manual filtering Is illustrated below for the ontological concept DESIRE, along with the synonyms from WordNet belonging to the same ontological class DESIRE want expect trust wish All these lexemes will be mapped to the concept DESIRE and minimally accept the same subcategomzatlons (e g np-v-np-xcomp as in I want you to /eel comfortable) We should mention that this step also Involved some manual filtering by acqulrers We used a machine-guided mode to help the acqulrer in this task This type of filtering was done very quickly, mainly due to the fact that WordNet is orgamzed on a semantic basis Using Levin's DB One of the major problems m using Levm's database was filtering out homonyms, as classes in Levm's database are defined on the basis of the same subcategonzatlon pattern (as seen in alternations) and not on a semantic basis, as shown by many researchers s The advantage of our approach is that ~t is semantic-based, this allows us to organize verbs into true (frame-based) semantic classes, with their associated sets of subcategonzatlons Therefore, we can pledlct that all velbs belonging to a particular semantra class Will have the Same syntactic behavior For instance, if one considers the serhantm class of aspectual verbs which selects a theme of type Event, e g begin, continue, finzsh, then one can minimally D~z~er (1996) also showed that these classes do not apply easfly to French a multi-purpose LKB while keeping the costs of acqmsltmn as low as possible Semantic Multillnguahty By mapping lexemes to concepts, it is possible to create lexicons for dufferent languages, at a mmlmum cost, once a core lexicon has been acquired Th~s task can be further accelerated if one has access to blhngual d~ctmnames to semi-automate the translatmn task Finally, if one has access to a rlch structured ontology (as is the case in Mlkrokosmos) then dynamic procedures (e g, generalization, speciahzatmn) can help the acqulrer in ""filling"" the gap m the case of lexlco-semantm mismatches (e g, cook, bake ~ cuwe) More Related Languag e Multflinguahty: Morpho:semantics All the LRs (e g, LR2agent-o]) developed for Spanlsh can be used to extend other languages, even unrelated ones, in other words, these rules are language mdependent The morpho-semant,c aspect of the LRs is, however, specific to particular languages But, in order to benefit from the work done on morpho-semantlc LRs, we separated the assignmeat of affixes from the assignment of LRs In other words, if m Spanish LR~agent-of m ass~ghed to say the suffix -dot, by translating suffixes between languages, (-dot -+ -cur in French), the French lexlcon can be extended m the same way (comprador --+ acheteur) Again, this work will necesmtate some manual checking, because of some overgeneration, which cannot be accepted for generation But overall, one can use the same methodology, the same LRs and engine to produce new entries 5.3 Even More Related Language MultihnguahtY The subcategonzatlons attached to a lexeme have an even more idiosyncratic behavmr than lexlcal LRs But here agam, the rules we developed can be applied at least to family-related languages, and then filtered out by a human For mstance, the Spanish word comer has the pattern np-v-np associated to it (e g Juan come una pera), so this same pattern will be attached to the translatmn of comer (eat) as m (Juan eats a pear) However, gomg from Spanish to English, one misses all the alternatmns (Lewn, 1993) not common in Spanish such as John gave Mary a book 6 Summary The MIkrokosmos lexicon acqulmtlon group has acquired the following data -Spanish lexicon 7,000 word sense entrms (35,000 word sense entries after applying the morpho-semantm lexlcal rules), Chinese lexicon about 3,000 word sense entries, and Enghsh, about 15,000 word sense entrms so far For instance, the acquisition of 15,000 word sense entries took one year and involved 50% of the time of a computational hngmst (to develop the methodology, train the acqulrers and design the GUIs), 50 acqmrer hours per week, 10 hours per week of a programmer to tmplement the GUIs, mamtam the tools and test the entries Our approach to the development of lex, cons differs from others m that our rules apply directly to semantlc frames and not to the basic forms of verbs Our methodology allows us to alleviate the burden of manual checking by applying linking rules directly on the semantics of the lexemes Some rules add discourse related features, such as focus m some alternations, e g, they zmproved the s~tuatwn --+ the s~tuatzon zmproved What is Important to evaluate is how much do we gam by using rules and other resources Today, ~t ~s still d~fficult to say exactly how much Adequately predicting the subcategonzatlons for a semantic class depends on its gram size the finergrained, the better the pred2ctwn wall be However, m NLP apphcatlons, where one Is constramed by tlme, only the semantics necessary for a particular application is acquired, which means that m many cases the semantms is left at a coarser grain s~ze than the one required to predict the subcategomzatlons In practice, we overgenerate some subcategortzatlons and need therefore to have them checked by humans This ~s why we have concentrated on a small set of rules Results on that trade-off issue have been reported in Vmgas et al (1998) Our experience in large-scale acqulsltmn of lexicons shows that Idiosyncrasies overrule many of our general rules This is mainly due to the fact that we need a more fine-gramed semantms than the one which is available now This ,s not just a criticism of our framework, ,t is a genelal fact that we all encounter when mvestlgatmg lexlcal semantics This might be due to the fact that we work m a synchronic perspective (a highly recommended approachl), whereas language evolves constantly, thus creatmg ""artificial"" ldmsyncrasms In any case one cannot avold them when butldmg a computatmnal semantic lexicon We have also learnt dunng the acquisition of the Mtkrokosmos lexmons that different acqulrers, who have been through the same Intensive tralmng, will arrive at the same numbel of meanings for a word, in more than 90% of the cases The meaning of a word might differ, for different trained acqulrers, along ISA links Corpora also Influence the decision of the acqmrers, and here too we have seen some human ""mconsltencms"" which we thmk could be ""corrected"" automatically, as discussed in the followmg section [NPI, NP2, PPI] A-CREATEINGEST [ARGI, ARO2, ARQ3, ARC4, ] B -CREATEINGESTBENEF C-CREATEINGESTTHEME [ARGI, ARG2, ARG3] [ARGI, haG2] Looking at example (1), and m absence of examples (2) and (3) in the corpus, fix could easily be mapped into A or C, whereas with examples (2) and (3), and m absence of example (1) m the corpus, ~t could be easily mapped into A or B by the acqmrers We clmm that thin is of no importance as far as there are mechamsms to go from one to the other This requires to have access to semantic reformation The dmgram above is a computational hngumt construct and has no ""reality"" per se B and C are constructs which provide for every semantic class the different semantic patterns that a particular semantic class accepts, such as the pattern CRE-ATEINGESTBENEF requires 3 semantm arguments (AGENT, BENEFICIARY and THEME), whereas CRE-ATEINGESTTHEME only reqmres 2 semantic arguments In this case, thin means that the BENEFI-CIARY IS optional, a fact the acqmrer ""failed"" to recogmze This diagram can be further specified for a particular natural language, where the required arguments are mapped to syntactic arguments and where lexlcal rules for a particular language provide the link between the different semantic patterns for a semantic class The dmgram below is for English where 6We g*ve the general diagram for CREATEINGEST events, as PREPAREFOOD is a subtype and will inherit all the properties of the semantic class CREATEINGEST The corpus can indeed Influence the way a lexicon acqmrer will do the mapping So if a lexicon acqmrer creates an unspecffied entry (mapping fix on (A), as opposed to (B) or (C)), dynamic mechamsms such as speclahzatlon or generahzatmn would enable the system to get to (B) and (C) from (A) and vice versa (to (A) from (B) or (C)) Moreover, ff a lexicon acqmrer decides to map to (B) instead of (C) or vine versa, then a lexmal rule (LR) between (B) and (C) will enable the system to go from (B) to (C) and wce versa In other words, although there are three potentrolly different ways of writing the lexlcon entry for fix for example sentences (1), ( 2 ) and (3), these different ways of encoding fix should remain a virtual difference at processing t~me the system must encode mechanisms and rules to ""interpret"" and reconcile the different points of wew of different acqmrels This enables the system to process sentences (1), ( 2 ) and (3) from any of the three p0tentml lexicon entries We beheve that an unportant msue m computational semantics m

1875,7365619,"In this paper, we report on our experience in buildmg computational semantic lexicons for use in NLP applications In a machine-graded approach, the computer reduces part of the semantic knowledge to be acquired by an acqulrer An overt semantics can help predict the syntactic behavior of words By overt semantics we mean applying the hnkmg or lexlcal rules at the semantic level and not on lexlcal base forms More specffically~ we address the different strategies of acqms~tlon arguing for an applicationdriven, training-intensive effort We also report on how to develop lexicons using off the shelf resources, and address multlhngual issues We will try to provide an assessment of the difficulties we encountered and some directions to bypass them 1 Introduction Our experience in building computational semantic lexlcons which are used by Natural Language Processmg (NLP) systems comes from Mlkrokosmos, a knowledge-based machine translation system, 1 where texts from Spanish and Chinese are translated into Enghsh Mlkr0k~n~os adopts an xnterhnguabased approach (Nlrenfurg et al, 1992) and all lexicons can be used for multdmgual analysis and generatmn each word is mapped to an mterhngua structure The lexicons built for Mlkrokosmos are multipurpose multlhngual to support translation or multflmgual generatmn tasks, reusable, that is, apphcable to several NLP tasks~ (e g, generation, analysis, information extraction), and maintainable, that Is, supporting semi-automatic acquisition and restructuring of the lexicons The content of the Lexlcal Knowledge Base (LKB) ~s essentially the same ~rrespective of a particular application The types of information important for analysis and generation might differ, as suggested by Dale and Melhsh (1998) For instance, recording all the senses of a lexeme is more important for analysis than generation, conversely, knowing styhstlc mformation on words such as hzghfalutm or formal m 1For a descnptmn of Mlkrokosmos, see http//crl nmsu edu/Research/Projects/nukro/mdex html important for generation (Hovy, 1988) The content of a multl-purpose LKB is apphcatlon Independent (modulo its indexing m analysis the LKB Is Indexed on lexemes whereas for generation the LKB is indexed on concepts) We argue, m section 2 that the acquisition process ~s apphcatmn-dependent Moleover we argue that defining the meamng of a word for NLP systems requires a training-intensive effolt In other words, the fact that we, as humans, understand texts does not entail that we can determine the ""computational"" meaning of a word Chomsklan trees are linguists' constructs, not Innate structures A hngmst must be trained to be able to build syntactic patterns (e g, trees) In computational semantics, the same rule applies one must be trained to build the corresponding semantics (e g frames, predicates, ) for a word In order to approach the ""computational"" meaning of a word, training Is the most important means we have to date to ensure consistency among acquuers Other means are to adopt an overt semantics with a machine-guided approach which directs as much as possible the acqulrer (Section 3) This machine guided approach could also act behind the ' back"" of an acquner ""correcting ~' some mc0nslstencms m lexmal descnptlons between acqmrers, as will be shown m Sectmn 6 In Section 4, we &scuss our use of off the shelf lesources, such as WordNet (Miller, 1990) , to accelerate the machine-graded acqmsltlon of the Enghsh lexicon by taking advantage of the existing database of synsets 2 whmh provide synonym lists for a lexeme We also show how a semantic-based approach, can help predict the syntactic behavior of words Note that the reverse (predicting semantms from syntax) is not true, as some experiments on Levm's work (1993) have shown (Sectmn 4) In Sectmn 5, we address mulUlmgual issues in lexicon development 2 Application-driven Acquisition The semantics of an entry is an underspecffied Text Meaning Representation (TMR) fragment (e g, De-fnse and Nlrenburg, 1991) Th,s TMR fragment can be a concept from the ontology or some lnterhngua structures such as att,tudes, modahtms, aspects, sets and TMR relatmns (addltion, enumeratlon, compamson) Concepts and lnterhngua structures can appear together or independently The ontology, to which lexemes are mapped, conmsts of concepts (named sets of property-value pairs) organized hlerarchmally along subsumptlon hnks, w~th an average of 14 relational hnks (such as ISA, SUBCLASS, AGENT, THEME-OF, HEADED-BY, HAS-MEMBER) per concept (Mahesh, 1996) In a multflmgual enwronment, the main practical advantage of connectmg the lexlcon to an ontology is cost-effect,veness, as only the ""language-dependent"" propertms have tO be acquired when adding new natural laffh~iages to the system The mapping between a word and the ontology is the most difficult task of lexicon acquisition, and requires to develop the most cost-effective approach in terms of trmmng and strategms 2 1 Importance of Training The expemment reported below shows that training is essential to determine the ""computational"" meanmg of a word A native spea]~er of Spanish, who had not taken part m the lexacon traanmg process, was asked to add some senses to entries m the Spanish lexicon Thls was mainly done for testing the analyzer, as there were only 23 out of 167 words which were ambiguous m one text we were analyzing But we also d~scovered thls was a very useful exercise for testing the quahty of a semantic lexicon The list of added senses was reviewed by two computational hngmsts, one in charge of supervising the training and the other with proficiency m our framework who had seen entries as they were used by the analyzer but had not taken part to the training process either The untrained acqmrer, hereafter UN-ACQ, added a total of 111 to 55 open class words or so Among these 55 words where ambiguity had been added, 33 were already ambiguous in the Spanzsh lexicon After a closer look at the Spanish lexicon, and at the senses retrieved by the semantic analyzer, and after doing an on-hne corpora search, the computational hngulsts accepted less than 20 new senses among the 111 suggested This ""overge,aeratlor~"" of senses by UNACQ had different origins 1) the analyzer did not present all the senses from the Spanlsh lexicon to UNACQ, it only presented the ones that were accepted after syntactic binding, u) the senses added by UNACQ were ""equivalent"" to the senses already in the Spanish lexicon, but not recogmzed by UNACQ, as they were acquired as ""unspecffied"" in the Spanish lexicon, m) UNACQ hardcoded non-hteral meanings of the words, iv) the addition of senses was MRD-dnven UNACQ acquired the list of meanings provzded by the Spanlsh-Enghsh Larousse and Colhns, adopt,ng an enumeration approach Such a task Is not superficial, it ensures that the quahty of the core lexicon ,s good enough so that it can serve as a basis for lexicon expansion techtuques, some of which we develop below (see Vmgas (1999) for the choices an acqu,rer faces when workmg out the semantic mapping Of a word) Strategms There are mainly two approaches to word sense assignment corpus-dr,yen and mental-driven The former is better adapted to braiding lexicons used m analysis, whereas the latter better suits lexicons to be used in generation We refer to Kllganff (1997) for the corpus-driven approach, and discuss m this paper the mental-driven.approach A mental-driven or thesaurus-drlven approach consists m grouping together lexemes which share the same meaning In order to ensure consistency among acqulrers' mappings we have divided the process of acqu,rmg a coinputatlonal semantic lexicon into two phases preacquisition and acquisition There is still time to revise a pre-acqulred mapping at acquis,tlon time, if needed The Pre-Acquisitmn Phase For a generatmn lexicon, the method of preparing the pre-acqulsltlon files can be as follows 1) extract all concepts from the ontology, n) lexlcahze them usmg on-hne thesauri, dlctlonanes and native speakers' lntultmns, m) order pre-acqulsltion files accordmg to the semantic Mapping-Tag (see below) A pre-acqmmtion record includes 7 fields Semantics, Mapping-Tag, Lexeme, POS, Translations, Fie-quency_, and Polysemy-Count The Semantics field includes only the ontological head concept, in which the word sense should be anchored (no selectlonal restrictions or other ptopertms are specified at this stage) The Mapping-Tag field (see below) describes the type of connectloa between the word sense and its conceptual meanmg some word senses are directly mapped (""dim"" map) to a single concept in the ontology, wheleas the meaning of some other word senses is descllbed through the combination of concepts hnked vm propertles (relations or attributes) We defined seven tags which flag the entry for a specific task For mstance, ""devb"" (deverbal) is used primarily for nouns and adjectives when their meaning is a composition of a filler and an event (e g bombing, readable), ""asp"" (aspecttral) is used for true aspectuals (e g begin) and also with actions expressing aspectuallty (e g stare, duration prolonged) The Translatmns field includes an English translation (for languages other than English) Frequency, POS and polysemy count are extracted automatically, using on-hne large corpora for frequency, and WordNet for • .in mm the part of speech and the polysemy count Bihngum dictionaries, filtered by a native speaker of the foreign language, are used for the translations into English (for the acquisition of languages other than English) In order to increase speed at acqulsitmn time, each acqmrer works on one type of Mapping-Tag at a time For instance, some acqmrers work on type OBJECT Type OBJECT call only be lexlcahzed into nouns, e g DEVICE -+ devzce instrument tool apphance Others work on the type EVENT ~VENTS can be lexlcahzed into nouns, e g EXPLODE --~ bombzn9, bombardment, or into verbs bomb, bombard, drop_bombs_on, throw_bombs_at In order to increase consistency, acquIrers go through specially designed trammg sessions 3 Overt Semantics to Predict Syntax: A Machine-guided Approach Mappings between semantic roles and syntacUc complements axe defined via a mapping (a rule) These mappings can be defined for large sub-classes of lexical entries For example, the rule Atl;-Pred-Adj creates an entry which accepts in the semantic feature a concept from the subtree of ATTRIBUTE or an ATTITUDE and accepts attributive (e g safe car) and predlcat,ve uses (e g the car zs sa]e) In the case of an adjecUve mapped to a RELATION (e g MENTAL-OBJECT-RELATION) the preferred rule would be Att-Adj generating an attributive reading (e g, dental practzce), and not (~the practice ~s dental) By selecting the appropriate mapping for classes of entries, it is possible to hide the mapping from the acqulrer since these mappings are defined in a lexlcal class, not m an instance As defined by an acqulrer, an entry looks as follows [key ""safe"", syn Att-Pred-Adj, sem [name Safety-Attrlbute, range Safe]], During compilation of the dictionary, the Att-Pred-Ad 3 label is replaced with its definition and makes explicit the co-reference between the subcategorization and the semantics So far we have developed for the English lexicon about twenty syntactic patterns whmh apply to a large number of semantic frames In the case of adjectives, we have 3 rules, one for attributive adjectives, another one for predicative adjectives, and a third one for attributive adjective used predicatively In the case of nouns, we have developed four patterns as Illustrated below We presented above the labels of subcategorlzation patterns as they appear at acqms~tlon time At processing time, there is no difference between Obll and Ob12, which are both of type Oblique Our machine-graded approach helps the acqmrer to select a rule as it only presents the relevant ones for a specffic semantic type For instance, in the case of a lexeme mapped to an OBJECT no rules having obliques will be presented to the acqmrer as described below The table above should be read as follows the first column provides type examples for nouns, the second column (semantics) provides the list of semantlc types that a noun can be, Obj (Object), Prop (Property) and Event, the third column (subcategonzation) presents all subcategorizations a noun can subcategorize for, the fourth column (lexlcal class) concatenates the semantics and the subcategorization For instance EventNObjObllObjEventOb12Opt' is the lexmal, class of nouns.which are of.type 'Event' and therefore subcategorlze for two obhques (Obl) -the former must be Obj whereas the latter can be either Obj or Event These Obl can be optional (Opt) Acqmrers may specify the preposition (head of the oblique or preposlUonal phrase) For Instance, in the case of lather, once an acqulrer has mapped the word to the concept ' Father"" which is a Prop (Property) the acquisition tool presents the subcategorizatmn NObllOpt This allows the acquirer to select wluch prepositlon(s) can go with the range of Father (in this case ""of"" will be selected) This Information is important in generation For generation, one must specify, at acquisition tlme, whether or not one can say the bombing o/Iraq , the bombing of Iraq by the US ~ the bombing by the US It also helps in word sense dxsamblguation In the case of verbs, one can also define lexicosyntactic classes for different semantic classes For instance, in the case of ASSERTIVEACT the lexemes mapped to it will accept a comp clause (e g he sazd (that,) he would come) One class of aspectuals subcategonzes for nps (e g I started a new book), xcomps (e g I started reading/Tinting a new book), and accepts the intransitive alternation when the grammatical object is of type Event (e g the surgery started very late) 3 Propagation of Lexicons In this section, we briefly discuss how to extend a lexmon using denvatlonal morphology, and off the shelf resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1990) to propagate the English lexicon with synonyms, and Levm's database of subcategonzatlons and alternations for Enghsh verbs (Levm, 1993) to encode syntactic information m the verb entries 4 Morpho-semantics for Derlvatlonal Morphology We refer the reader to Vmgas et al (1996) for the details on this type of acquisition and theoretical background of Lexlcal Rules (LRs) To sketch this operation briefly, applying morpho semantic LRs to the entry

adjectives and the semantics adds the attribute FEA-SIBILITYATTRIBUTE to the basic meaning BuY of comprar (Vmgas et al, 1996) WordNet has been used as follows We extracted the synsets assooated with a lexeme using fuzzy string matches between, on the one hand, the value of the ontological concept (e g, DESIRE), its defimtlon (e g, for DESIRE ""to want something"") and the concept and definition of ~ts corresponding ISA concept (e g, INTEND) and, on the other hand, the direct hypernyms and hyponyms for the lexeme m 3See Vmgas et al (1999) for the details on the web raterfaces used for the acqulsltmn 4See Vlegas et al (1998) for more details WordNet synsets For instance, for the English verb expect, mapped to the ontological concept DESIRE our algorithm only kept one synset hope, expect, trust, deswe for expect and the following synsets for Its hypernyms wzsh, des:re, want The output of our automatlc procedure and manual filtering Is illustrated below for the ontological concept DESIRE, along with the synonyms from WordNet belonging to the same ontological class DESIRE want expect trust wish All these lexemes will be mapped to the concept DESIRE and minimally accept the same subcategomzatlons (e g np-v-np-xcomp as in I want you to /eel comfortable) We should mention that this step also Involved some manual filtering by acqulrers We used a machine-guided mode to help the acqulrer in this task This type of filtering was done very quickly, mainly due to the fact that WordNet is orgamzed on a semantic basis Using Levin's DB One of the major problems m using

verbs which selects a theme of type Event, e g begin, continue, finzsh, then one can minimally D~z~er (1996) also showed that these classes do not apply easfly to French a multi-purpose LKB while

(as is the case in Mlkrokosmos) then dynamic procedures (e g, generalization, speciahzatmn) can help the acqulrer in ""filling"" the gap m the case of lexlco-semantm mismatches (e g, cook, bake ~

But overall, one can use the same methodology, the same LRs and engine to produce new entries 5.3 Even More Related Language MultihnguahtY The subcategonzatlons attached to a lexeme have an even more idiosyncratic behavmr than lexlcal LRs But here agam, the rules we developed can be applied at least to family-related languages, and then filtered out by a human For mstance, the Spanish word comer has the pattern np-v-np associated to it (e g Juan come una pera), so this same pattern will be attached to the translatmn of comer (eat) as m (Juan eats a pear) However, gomg from Spanish to English, one misses all the alternatmns (Lewn, 1993) not common in Spanish such as John gave Mary a book 6 Summary The MIkrokosmos lexicon acqulmtlon group has acquired the following data -Spanish lexicon 7,000 word sense entrms (35,000 word sense entries after applying the morpho-semantm lexlcal rules), Chinese lexicon about 3,000 word sense entries, and Enghsh, about 15,000 word sense entrms so far For instance, the acquisition of 15,000 word sense entries took one year and involved 50% of the time of a computational hngmst (to develop the methodology, train the acqulrers and design the GUIs), 50 acqmrer hours per week, 10 hours per week of a programmer to tmplement the GUIs, mamtam the tools and test the entries Our approach to the development of lex, cons differs from others m that our rules apply directly to semantlc frames and not to the basic forms of verbs Our methodology allows us to alleviate the burden of manual checking by applying linking rules directly on the semantics of the lexemes Some rules add discourse related features, such as focus m some alternations, e g, they zmproved the s~tuatwn --+ the s~tuatzon zmproved What is Important to evaluate is how much do we gam by using rules and other resources Today, ~t ~s still d~fficult to say exactly how much Adequately predicting the subcategonzatlons for a semantic class depends on its gram size the finergrained, the better the pred2ctwn wall be However, m NLP apphcatlons, where one Is constramed by tlme, only the semantics necessary for a particular application is acquired, which means that m many cases the semantms is left at a coarser grain s~ze than the one required to predict the subcategomzatlons In practice, we overgenerate some subcategortzatlons and need therefore to have them checked by humans This ~s why we have concentrated on a small set of rules Results on that trade-off issue have been reported in Vmgas et al (1998) Our experience in large-scale acqulsltmn of lexicons shows that Idiosyncrasies overrule many of our general rules This is mainly due to the fact that we need a more fine-gramed semantms than the one which is available now This ,s not just a criticism of our framework, ,t is a genelal fact that we all encounter when mvestlgatmg lexlcal semantics This might be due to the fact that we work m a synchronic perspective (a highly recommended approachl), whereas language evolves constantly, thus creatmg ""artificial"" ldmsyncrasms In any case one cannot avold them when butldmg a computatmnal semantic lexicon We have also learnt dunng the acquisition of the Mtkrokosmos lexmons that different acqulrers, who have been through the same Intensive tralmng, will arrive at the same numbel of meanings for a word, in more than 90% of the cases The meaning of a word might differ, for different trained acqulrers, along ISA links Corpora also Influence the decision of the acqmrers, and here too we have seen some human ""mconsltencms"" which we thmk could be ""corrected"" automatically, as discussed in the followmg section [NPI, NP2, PPI] A-CREATEINGEST [ARGI, ARO2, ARQ3, ARC4, ] B -CREATEINGESTBENEF C-CREATEINGESTTHEME [ARGI, ARG2, ARG3] [ARGI, haG2] Looking at example (1), and m absence of examples (2) and (3) in the corpus, fix could easily be mapped into A or C, whereas with examples (2) and (3), and m absence of example (1) m the corpus, ~t could be easily mapped into A or B by the acqmrers We clmm that thin is of no importance as far as there are mechamsms to go from one to the other This requires to have access to semantic reformation The dmgram above is a computational hngumt construct and has no ""reality"" per se B and C are constructs which provide for every semantic class the different semantic patterns that a particular semantic class accepts, such as the pattern CRE-ATEINGESTBENEF requires 3 semantm arguments (AGENT, BENEFICIARY and THEME), whereas CRE-ATEINGESTTHEME only reqmres 2 semantic arguments In this case, thin means that the BENEFI-CIARY IS optional, a fact the acqmrer ""failed"" to recogmze This diagram can be further specified for a particular natural language, where the required arguments are mapped to syntactic arguments and where lexlcal rules for a particular language provide the link between the different semantic patterns for a semantic class The dmgram below is for English where 6We g*ve the general diagram for CREATEINGEST events, as PREPAREFOOD is a subtype and will inherit all the properties of the semantic class CREATEINGEST The corpus can indeed Influence the way a lexicon acqmrer will do the mapping So if a lexicon acqmrer creates an unspecffied entry (mapping fix on (A), as opposed to (B) or (C)), dynamic mechamsms such as speclahzatlon or generahzatmn would enable the system to get to (B) and (C) from (A) and vice versa (to (A) from (B) or (C)) Moreover, ff a lexicon acqmrer decides to map to (B) instead of (C) or vine versa, then a lexmal rule (LR) between (B) and (C) will enable the system to go from (B) to (C) and wce versa In other words, although there are three potentrolly different ways of writing the lexlcon entry for fix for example sentences (1), ( 2 ) and (3), these different ways of encoding fix should remain a virtual difference at processing t~me the system must encode mechanisms and rules to ""interpret"" and reconcile the different points of wew of different acqmrels This enables the system to process sentences (1), ( 2 ) and (3) from any of the three p0tentml lexicon entries We beheve that an unportant msue m computational semantics m
