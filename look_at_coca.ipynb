       "'is injuries are part of the game <p> Lions running back Ameer Abdullah has been placed on injured reserve after having surgery . ( Photo : Robin Buckson , Detroit News ) <p> Allen Park -- The mantra is \" next man up , \" but that \\'s more of a defense mechanism than a strategy . It \\'s a way of coping off the field as much as it is on it . <p> It \\'s dispassionate by design , because just about everyone knows what it feels like to be the man who goes down at some point in their career . And in a league often defined by its violence , no one wants to dwell on the seemingly inevitable consequence of it . <p> The injury rate in the NFL is 100 percent , as the saying goes . <p> The Vikings , who lost starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to a devastating knee injury before their opener , announced Wednesday that All-Pro running back Adrian Peterson also will undergo knee surgery and is out indefinitely , while starting left tackle Matt Kalil went on injured reserve with a hip injury . <p> In Chicago , quarterback Jay Cutler will miss the rest of this month , at least , with a sprained thumb on his throwing hand , while last year \\'s sack leader Lamarr Houston is lost for the season with a torn ACL . Linebacker Danny Trevathan is among a handful of starters also out indefinitely for the 0-2 Bears . <p> And for Green Bay and Detroit -- two division rivals that \\'ll meet Sunday at Lambeau Field -- much of the talk Wednesday centered around who wo n\\'t be playing , rather than who will . A week ago , the Lions had one player -- linebacker DeAndre Levy -- missing at Wednesday \\'s initial practice . <p> \" But that \\'s part of the game -- everybody has injuries all across the board , \" Lions coach Jim Caldwell said . \" It \\'s just whether or not you want to make it an excuse , and we \\'re not going to make it an excuse . We \\'re going to find a way to get better . \" <p> They have no choice , obviously , in the wake of last weekend \\'s brutal home loss to Tennessee , with road games at Green Bay and Chicago the next two weeks . <p> \" We \\'ve got to continue to call the same football plays , \" quarterback Matthew Stafford said Wednesday , \" and have the other guys on our roster step up and make plays . \" At the same time , we understand that there \\'s a job that still needs to get done . We need to move on . It \\'s unfortunate for that person , but they do n\\'t pause the games , so ... \" <p> \\' Volume seems high \\' <p> So you say what they all say , from the coaches on down : Next man up . <p> As for the rash of injuries thus far ? <p> \" I \\'m not on top of what the numbers are , but I think it \\'s really a reflection of today \\'s NFL , unfortunately , \" Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy said . \" Injuries have always been a part of the game . It \\'s just a challenge . I know everybody is paying close attention to it . <p> Still , he adds , \" The volume definitely seems high . \" <p> If true , and it \\'s hard to say at this point , the reasons likely are varied . Today \\'s players are bigger , faster and stronger than ever before , but the equipment , the training and the rules have n\\'t necessarily kept pace . Newer concussion protocols could be a factor . And some in the league even have suggested that limiting offseason contact -- player-safety concessions included in the NFL \\'s 2011 collective bargaining agreement -- may play a role as well . <p> \" There \\'s nothing you can do about it , so there \\'s really no sense of complaining about it , \" McCarthy said , when asked about that last notion . \" But I \\'m not a fan of the offseason structure at all . \" <p> Players understand <p> No one \\'s a fan of the carnage , though . Players come limping in Monday , the news comes trickling out Tuesday , and it \\'s not always easy to swallow . <p> \" It \\'s tough , man , \" said Glover Quin , the veteran Lions safety . \" You just feel for guys that have to deal with that . You never want to see guys go out like that , regardless of what team , whether it \\'s Adrian Peterson ... or guys from Green Bay .'"
