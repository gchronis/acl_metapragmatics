Hannah knew that was n\\'t the case . The land of the frozen north had four seasons -- Fishing Season , Duck Season , Deer Season , and Mud Season . This was the first Thursday in April and Lake Eden was having the worst Mud Season on record . In the past three days , Earl Flensburg had used his Winnetka County tow truck to pull eighteen vehicles out of the muddy ditches . This number included Hannah \\'s cookie truck . Twice . <p> The current road conditions had been brought about by an extremely snowy winter that had yielded a record number of inches . Then , just last week , the days had turned warm with temperatures approaching a positively balmy fifty degrees . Hapless motorists on the highways skidded on the icy film . If they were lucky , they simply ended up in the ditch in need of a tow truck . If they were unlucky , they sideswiped several other cars , resulting in multiple injuries . Warnings about the hazardous road conditions filled the KCOW-TV evening news , but some drivers seemed perfectly oblivious . Until the weather evened out , one way or the other , accidents on the highway would continue to be more common than lost mittens . <p> Hannah gripped the wheel tightly . Road conditions would improve once they turned onto the gravel road that led to the Lake Eden Inn , but they still had over five miles to go on asphalt that resembled nothing so much as an improperly frozen hockey rink . They were on their way to meet Lonnie and his cousin , Devin , at the Lake Eden Inn . There they \\'d enjoy a preview of Sally and Dick Laughlin \\'s first-ever weekend jazz festival by listening to the headliner band , the Cinnamon Roll Six , rehearse for their performance the following night . When the rehearsal was over , the Swensen sisters would help Sally serve Hannah \\'s Special Cinnamon Rolls to the small crowd that had been invited to the musical sneak-peek . <p> The cinnamon rolls smelled wonderful and Hannah \\'s stomach growled . She had n\\'t taken time for lunch , and she did her best to resist an almost overwhelming urge to reach in the back and snag one for herself . Only the fact that she had to keep both hands on the wheel kept her from indulging that urge . Then they \\'d secured them in the back of the cookie truck and headed for the highway . Now the interior was filled with the mouthwatering scents of warm bread , cinnamon , and chocolate , and Hannah was getting more ravenous by the minute . <p> Michelle gave a wistful sigh . \" I do n\\'t know how much longer I can hold out . Those rolls smell scrumptious . \" <p> \" I was thinking the same thing myself . Maybe we should ... uh-oh ! \" Hannah stopped speaking abruptly as brake lights began to flash on the roadway ahead . \" Holy ... ! \" <p> \" Cow ! \" Michelle supplied , finishing the phrase with a much more socially acceptable word than the one that Hannah had been about to utter . \" What \\'s going on up there ? \" <p> \" I do n\\'t know , but it looks like trouble . And we \\'re not sticking around to find out ! \" <p> Hannah barreled past a speed limit sign that warned motorists to slow to fifteen miles an hour . She knew she was going much faster than that , but she did n\\'t take her eyes off the road to check as she muscled her truck around the icy curves . When she reached the straightaway that ran past the rest stop , she skidded on a patch of ice and came very close to crashing into the faded Minnesota state map with the red YOU ARE HERE arrow pointing to Lake Eden . Still going well over the posted speed limit , her truck whizzed past the metal picnic table and barely missed wiping out on the corner of the concrete block restrooms . <p> They were deep in the pine forest now and the ice and snow lay in patches on the road . Hannah , the taller of the two sisters , felt her hair graze the top of the truck . <p> \" We made it , \" Hannah said in a shaky voice , stating the obvious . <p> \" We did . I really do n\\'t know how you managed to get us here in one piece . \" <p> \" Neither do I. \" Hannah realized that she \\'d been holding her breath and she took a deep gulp of air . And then , because she felt decidedly lightheaded , she lowered the window for a breath of fresh cold air . <p> Michelle did the same and then she turned to give her sister an unsteady smile . \" That could have been bad , but you turned off just in time , and we ... \" Michelle stopped short and leaned closer to the open window . Hannah answered , listening to sounds of metal striking metal with considerable force . \" It \\'s a good thing we got off the highway when we did . It sounds like a really bad accident . \" <p> \" More than one accident . It \\'s a chain reaction . They \\'re still crashing over there and it must be a massive pileup . Do you think we should go back and try to help ? \" <p> \" Yes , but first we need to call the sheriff \\'s station . Do you have your cell phone ? \" <p> \" Right here . \" Michelle pulled it out of her pocket . \" What do you want me to say ? \" <p> \" Tell them it \\'s a multi-vehicle accident and to come out here right away . There are bound to be injuries , so they should put in a call for ambulances . Tell the dispatcher to alert Doc Knight at the hospital so he can set up to receive the accident victims . \" <p> \" Okay . It \\'s ringing now . I \\'ll tell the dispatcher what \\'s happening . \" <p> As Michelle began to relay the information to the sheriff \\'s station , Hannah turned the truck around . This took several minutes as the road was narrow , and they could n\\'t be of much help if they wound up stuck in the ditch . Her window was still down and she realized that the squeal of brakes and loud crashes had stopped . With the exception of a car horn that had stuck , the night was eerily silent . And then , just as she was about to pull out onto the access road that paralleled the highway , sirens wailed in the distance . Help was coming , and from the sounds of the breaking glass and impacts they \\'d heard only seconds before , it was n\\'t a moment too soon . All had sirens wailing and lights flashing as they approached the accident scene . <p> \" It \\'s bad , \" Michelle said , as they got close enough to see the twisted wreckage . <p> \" I know . Look up there on the left about fifty feet ahead . There \\'s a bus upside down in the ditch . And there \\'s so much wreckage spread out on the road , I do n\\'t think the emergency vehicles can get to it . \" <p> \" You \\'re right . They \\'ll have to hike in and it \\'s a ways . Let \\'s get as close as we can on the access road and walk in through the ditch . I took a class in first aid and maybe I can do something to help . At least we can try to get the bus doors open so the passengers can get out . \" <p> Hannah drove forward until she was adjacent to the overturned bus . It could be muddy at the bottom of the ditch . \" <p> Michelle reached the bottom first and turned back . \" It \\'s still frozen . It must be because it does n\\'t get any sun with all these trees . \" <p> The snow was deep at the bottom of the ditch and the two sisters waded through it with some difficulty . Then they started up the steep bank on the other side and made their way toward the overturned bus . <p> \" I do n\\'t hear anything , \" Michelle said as they got closer to the bus . \" Maybe everyone inside is okay and they \\'re just waiting for someone to come and help them get out . \" <p> Or maybe everyone inside is unconscious or dead , Hannah thought , but she did n\\'t say it . That was speculation on her part , and there was no sense in upsetting Michelle until they were able to get inside the bus and assess the situation for themselves . There are n\\'t any regular busses painted gold . I wish I could read what it says on the side , but the letters are upside down and backwards . \" <p> \" It \\'s the band bus . \" <p> \" What band ? \" <p> \" The Cinnamon Roll Six . \" <p> \" How do you know that ? \" <p> \" It says Cinnamon Roll Six on the side . \" <p> Michelle was silent for a moment , trying to make out the letters . \" You could be right . Can you actually read it , or are you just guessing ? \" <p> \" I can read it . I taught myself to read backwards and upside down when you and Andrea were kids and I was helping you with your homework . \" <p> \" But why did you have to learn to read upside down and backwards ? \" <p> \" It was easier than getting up and walking around to read over your shoulders . \" Hannah reached out to grab Michelle \\'s arm . \" <p> Another twenty feet and they had arrived at the back of the bus . It was wedged between two trees and it had obviously rammed into a third , even larger tree . From the wide swath the bus had cut through the spirea and gooseberry bushes , it had obviously rolled over and slid on its top to the place where it was now lodged . <p> \" We ca n\\'t get in the passenger door , \" Michelle said , walking around the bus . \" It \\'s blocked by those tree branches . Do n\\'t most charter busses have an escape hatch cut into the top ? \" <p> \" Yes , but the top of the bus is now the bottom , and it \\'s buried in several feet of snow . We \\'ll have to get in through the back door . Come on , Michelle . Let \\'s go . \" <p> Both sisters headed around the bus , lifting pine branches as they went . The handle wo n\\'t budge . \" <p> \" It must be locked from the inside . \" <p> \" You \\'re right . Let \\'s see if anybody inside can hear us . \" <p> \" Hello ? \" Michelle called out . \" Are you okay in there ? \" <p> They waited a moment or two , but there was no answer . Hannah stepped closer and yelled as loudly as she could . \" We need someone to open the back door . Can anyone get there to unlock it ? \" <p> The only sounds they heard were the distant sirens of emergency vehicles speeding to the accident site , and the wind whistling through the pines . Inside the locked bus , all was ominously silent . <p> Chapter Two The two sisters waited breathlessly . Hannah was almost positive that they were thinking the same dire thought . Was everyone dead inside the bus ? voice came from the interior of the bus . \" I was riding in the back . Give me a minute and I \\'ll get there . \" <p> Several moments later there was the sound of a lock clicking , and the back door swung open to reveal a handsome but haggard-looking man with strips of cloth wrapped around his wrist . The cloth strips were holding a screwdriver in place as a makeshift brace . \" Are you doctors ? \" <p> \" No , \" Michelle answered . \" I \\'ve had first aid training , but that \\'s about it . \" <p> \" Who are you then ? \" <p> \" Two passing motorists who came to help , \" Hannah explained as quickly as she could . \" It may take the paramedics some time to get to you . The road \\'s blocked by the wreckage and they \\'ll have to hike in over half a mile . Is anyone inside badly injured ? \" <p> \" No . She used to work in a doctor \\'s office . \" <p> \" Lynnette \\'s a nurse ? \" Hannah asked . <p> He shook his head . \" She was in charge of the appointment desk , but she used to help the nurses when they got really busy . You know , hand them things and stuff like that . \" <p> \" Do you think your wrist is broken ? \" Michelle asked . <p> \" I do n\\'t think so , but I \\'m no doctor . I guess I can find out for sure from the paramedics , or the doctors ... if they ever get here . \" <p> You \\'re pretty impatient considering the accident happened less than five minutes ago , Hannah thought , but she did n\\'t say it . He \\'d been injured and she should make allowances for that . \" I \\'m sure they \\'ll come just as soon as they can , \" she said , giving him a comforting smile . \" Your splint looks just fine . It \\'s holding your wrist immobile and that \\'s exactly what it \\'s supposed to do . You \\'ll probably need X-rays when you get to the hospital , but you \\'re fine for now . Just be careful not to bang it against anything or try to use your right arm . You do n\\'t want to risk injuring it further , especially since you play keyboards . \" <p> \" You know me ? \" he asked , looking pleased . <p> \" Not personally , but I know your music . You \\'re Buddy Neiman , the keyboard player with Cinnamon Roll Six . \" <p> \" That \\'s right . \" Buddy gave her a long , assessing look . \" So you \\'re a fan ? \" <p> \" I certainly am . Your music is great . \" <p> \" Thanks . Hey ... maybe you want to get together for a drink or something after we play tomorrow night . \" <p> Hannah held her breath . Devin \\'s your biggest fan , and he \\'s the one who introduced me to your music . He \\'s got everything the Cinnamon Roll Six ever recorded , and he plays keyboards with the Jordan High jazz band . He told me he can hardly wait to meet you and tell you how great he thinks you are . \" <p> Hannah watched the play of expressions cross Buddy \\'s face . There was disappointment in the fact that Michelle had a boyfriend , regret that he \\'d asked her to have a drink since she \\'d assumed he was open to including her boyfriend and Devin , and pleased at the compliment to his musical talent . Flattery must have won out in the end , because he smiled . <p> \" I \\'d like to meet your boyfriend and his cousin , \" he said , going into fan mode . \" Devin sounds like a nice kid . \" <p> \" Oh , he is . He \\'s pretty talented , too . <p> Enough chit-chat , Hannah \\'s mind prodded . Get to what \\'s important . <p> \" You said there were n\\'t any other serious injuries unless you counted the driver , \" Michelle said , almost as if she \\'d read Hannah \\'s mind . \" What did you mean by that ? \" <p> \" He \\'s dead . \" <p> \" The driver is dead ? \" Hannah repeated , just to make sure she \\'d understood his response . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>'"

Then they started up the steep bank on the other side and made their way toward the overturned bus . <p> \" I do n\\'t hear anything , \" Michelle said as they got closer to the bus . \" Maybe everyone inside is okay and they \\'re just waiting for someone to come and help them get out . \" <p> Or maybe everyone inside is unconscious or dead , Hannah thought , but she did n\\'t say it . That was speculation on her part , and there was no sense in upsetting Michelle until they were able to get inside the bus and assess the situation for themselves . There are n\\'t any regular busses painted gold . I wish I could read what it says on the side , but the letters are upside down and backwards . \" <p> \" It \\'s the band bus . \" <p> \" What band ? \" <p> \" The Cinnamon Roll Six . \" <p> \" How do you know that ? \" <p> \" It says Cinnamon Roll Six on the side . \" <p> Michelle was silent for a moment , trying to make out the letters . \" You could be right . Can you actually read it , or are you just guessing ? \" <p> \" I can read it . I taught myself to read backwards and upside down when you and Andrea were kids and I was helping you with your homework . \" <p> \" But why did you have to learn to read upside down and backwards ? \" <p> \" It was easier than getting up and walking around to read over your shoulders . \" Hannah reached out to grab Michelle \\'s arm . \" <p> Another twenty feet and they had arrived at the back of the bus . It was wedged between two trees and it had obviously rammed into a third , even larger tree . From the wide swath the bus had cut through the spirea and gooseberry bushes , it had obviously rolled over and slid on its top to the place where it was now lodged . <p> \" We ca n\\'t get in the passenger door , \" Michelle said , walking around the bus . \" It \\'s blocked by those tree branches . Do n\\'t most charter busses have an escape hatch cut into the top ? \" <p> \" Yes , but the top of the bus is now the bottom , and it \\'s buried in several feet of snow . We \\'ll have to get in through the back door . Come on , Michelle . Let \\'s go . \" <p> Both sisters headed around the bus , lifting pine branches as they went . The handle wo n\\'t budge . \" <p> \" It must be locked from the inside . \" <p> \" You \\'re right . Let \\'s see if anybody inside can hear us . \" <p> \" Hello ? \" Michelle called out . \" Are you okay in there ? \" <p> They waited a moment or two , but there was no answer . Hannah stepped closer and yelled as loudly as she could . \" We need someone to open the back door . Can anyone get there to unlock it ? \" <p> The only sounds they heard were the distant sirens of emergency vehicles speeding to the accident site , and the wind whistling through the pines . Inside the locked bus , all was ominously silent . <p> Chapter Two The two sisters waited breathlessly . Hannah was almost positive that they were thinking the same dire thought . Was everyone dead inside the bus ? voice came from the interior of the bus . \" I was riding in the back . Give me a minute and I \\'ll get there . \" <p> Several moments later there was the sound of a lock clicking , and the back door swung open to reveal a handsome but haggard-looking man with strips of cloth wrapped around his wrist . The cloth strips were holding a screwdriver in place as a makeshift brace . \" Are you doctors ? \" <p> \" No , \" Michelle answered . \" I \\'ve had first aid training , but that \\'s about it . \" <p> \" Who are you then ? \" <p> \" Two passing motorists who came to help , \" Hannah explained as quickly as she could . \" It may take the paramedics some time to get to you . The road \\'s blocked by the wreckage and they \\'ll have to hike in over half a mile . Is anyone inside badly injured ? \" <p> \" No . She used to work in a doctor \\'s office . \" <p> \" Lynnette \\'s a nurse ? \" Hannah asked . <p> He shook his head . \" She was in charge of the appointment desk , but she used to help the nurses when they got really busy . You know , hand them things and stuff like that . \" <p> \" Do you think your wrist is broken ? \" Michelle asked . <p> \" I do n\\'t think so , but I \\'m no doctor . I guess I can find out for sure from the paramedics , or the doctors ... if they ever get here . \" <p> You \\'re pretty impatient considering the accident happened less than five minutes ago , Hannah thought , but she did n\\'t say it . He \\'d been injured and she should make allowances for that . \" I \\'m sure they \\'ll come just as soon as they can , \" she said , giving him a comforting smile . \" Your splint looks just fine . It \\'s holding your wrist immobile and that \\'s exactly what it \\'s supposed to do . You \\'ll probably need X-rays when you get to the hospital , but you \\'re fine for now . Just be careful not to bang it against anything or try to use your right arm . You do n\\'t want to risk injuring it further , especially since you play keyboards . \" <p> \" You know me ? \" he asked , looking pleased . <p> \" Not personally , but I know your music . You \\'re Buddy Neiman , the keyboard player with Cinnamon Roll Six . \" <p> \" That \\'s right . \" Buddy gave her a long , assessing look . \" So you \\'re a fan ? \" <p> \" I certainly am . Your music is great . \" <p> \" Thanks . Hey ... maybe you want to get together for a drink or something after we play tomorrow night . \" <p> Hannah held her breath . Devin \\'s your biggest fan , and he \\'s the one who introduced me to your music . He \\'s got everything the Cinnamon Roll Six ever recorded , and he plays keyboards with the Jordan High jazz band . He told me he can hardly wait to meet you and tell you how great he thinks you are . \" <p> Hannah watched the play of expressions cross Buddy \\'s face . There was disappointment in the fact that Michelle had a boyfriend , regret that he \\'d asked her to have a drink since she \\'d assumed he was open to including her boyfriend and Devin , and pleased at the compliment to his musical talent . Flattery must have won out in the end , because he smiled . <p> \" I \\'d like to meet your boyfriend and his cousin , \" he said , going into fan mode . \" Devin sounds like a nice kid . \" <p> \" Oh , he is . He \\'s pretty talented , too . <p> Enough chit-chat , Hannah \\'s mind prodded . Get to what \\'s important . <p> \" You said there were n\\'t any other serious injuries unless you counted the driver , \" Michelle said , almost as if she \\'d read Hannah \\'s mind . \" What did you mean by that ? \" <p> \" He \\'s dead . \" <p> \" The driver is dead ? \" Hannah repeated , just to make sure she \\'d understood his response . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>'"
