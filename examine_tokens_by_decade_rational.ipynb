    "Sense (1) falls more closely into the \"justifiable by reason\" sense than the \"formalism\" sense most commonly used in ACL publications. Perhaps it's not exactly the same flavor as the \"justifiable by reason\" sense used in 4. In any case, I imagine with the advent of connectionism and feture-based statistical machine learning, one sees a tendency towards the logic as a system of reasoning to be represented---the object being modeled---as opposed to logic as the model. The sense of logic as a system of inference or a course of action made necessary by application of logical methods is one which is not totalizing. These are partial logics, and often referred to point out a flaw or a limitation or a blind-spot in a particular line of reasoning. When this sense is used in machine learning, I hypothesize that this tendency will be less prevalent, due to the emergence of this use out of a meaning of logic which is supposed to be totalizing---a totalizing model of grammar. \n"
